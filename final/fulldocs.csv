History
Mr. is a 25 year right-handed man
from
who in
started to note slapping of his left foot. He noted trouble Dorsey and plantar flexing the
foot. This presented without pain numbness or paresthesia. He also noted some
weakness of his left hip abduction. In he states mentions someone spike does drink
ketamine. He has not noted much change in the deficits since He felt the ankle
weakness was fairly stable. However in recent weeks he did have some difficulty
descending steps. The left knee felt slightly weak. He was unable to run. He did not note
any weakness or impaired dexterity in his arms. He felt the right leg was strong
There was no viral prodrome, dysarthria, dysphagia, emotional and continence, cognitive
difficulties, or bladder symptoms.
He had an EMG by Dr.
This was unavailable for
review on epic. There were occasional fasciculations in the left tibial foot muscles.
However the patient reports that he was told he had active denervation changes in left L5-
$1 muscles. MRI of the lumbosacral spine was normal except for minimal L5-S1 disc
bulge. He was told this may be ALS.

Impression
There was electrophysiologic evidence left S1 greater than L5 focal anterior horn cell or
radicular dysfunction.
There was no electrophysiologic evidence of a diffuse disorder of motor neurons or
polyneuropathy.
Taken together, the clinical and electrophysiologic features suggest patient has a more
benign lower motor neuron syndrome such as flail leg syndrome. Multifocal motor
neuropathy is in the differential though the pattern of weakness and active denervation om
EMG appeared more myotomal than in a nerve pattern. I suspect weakness will progress
slowly and remain confined to the legs likely for a matter of years. It is possible progession
will arrest at some point. Occasionally, such patlents with these EMG findings can
progress to more typical progressive muscular atrophy.
I suggested the following labs-GM 1 titer, asialoGM 1 titer, CK, immunofixation and ANA.

Chief Complaint
Patient presents with
• Foot drop, bilateral
This encounter was conducted via a patient-initiated virtual visit in lieu of an in person visit due
to the current health emergency. This visit was completed via telemedicine due to the
restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic. All issues as below were discussed and addressed butno 
physical exam was performed unless allowed by visual confirmation and telecommunication.
Telemedicine Consent Form was reviewed with the patient giving verbal consent,
understanding there are certain limitations to receiving care via telemedicine. Patient verbally
consented to visit.
He has the visit with his wife.
s a 74 y.o. right handed male who presents here for the pain in the left lower
extremities and weakness of both feet.
Location: left leg, both feet.
Onset: gradually
Severity: severe
Quality: He was in good shape till mid when he woke up with a pain at left buttock.The pain 
radiated to the left leg and foot. If he had the shooting pain, the pain was more likely
on 
the 
calf muscle. He had sharp pain in the calf, too. Sometimes he felt the dull pain to
buttock, thigh, shin and calf. He feels more pain in at night. He reported a little numbness and
tingling on the left foot. He had the left foot drop a few days later after the initial pain. He isdoing 
PT at home.
He lost weight intentionally. He crossed the legs quite a bit.
He had the difficulty standing from the sitting positions.
He had difficulty walking because of the foot drop, pain on the left foot, and loss of balance.
He saw a NS. Who ordered EMG. The NS did not recommend the surgery. He referred to see
an pain management.
He saw an orthopedic who ordered MRI, too.
Duration: 2 months
Timing: worsening
Aggravating factors: none
Alleviating factors: none
Associated symptoms: he denied any weakness or numbness on the hands or arm or neck
pain.
Context: In he had the left toenail removed. He did not feel the pain. He suspected hemight have left toe 
numbness in He had had radiation therapy to prostate cancer.
Records reviewed: MRI L spine and EMG.
OSF EMG showed absent left peroneal motor and sensory with preservation of left sural nerve
and decreased amplitude of left tibial motor nerve. It also showed moderately decreased
amplitude of right peroneal motor and mildly decreased amplitude of peroneal sensory nerve
and right tibial motor nerve.
MRI L spine showed 1, left L5-S1 annular fissure; 2, smoothing of the fat intensity from L5
caudally.
He comes with his wife for follow up. He has the first visit with the video.
Since the last visit, he states that he denied any worsening weakness, although he did not have
any improvement. He has to wear the brace on the left foot.
He has numbness on left three toes and right great toe.
He recalled that his podiatrist advised him to see a neurologist after he was noted to have
reduced sensation on R foot. He finished the radiation treatment in
for the prostate
cancer.
He denied any difficulty swallowing or breathing. He denied any double vision or blurry vision.
He denied any history of upper respiratory infection or diarrhea before he noted the the foot
weakness.
I reviewed his lab work. The anti GM-11gM is very elevated,> 100. He has low B12 and low
gamma.
He comes with his wide for follow up.
He was admitted into for further work up including CSF study and EMG. The CSF showed
mild inflammation including protein 49 and normal WBC.
The EMG suggested axonal neuropathy.
He was in the hospital for 8 days.
He received the IVIG for 5 days.
He states that he did not feel no difference. He is still weak.
I reviewed his records. Again, he had significantly elevated anti-GM 1 antibody and
slightly low Vit D.

Chief Complaint:
1. Rapidly progressive right lower extremity weakness, complete foot drop
2. Pulmonary sarcoidosis
3. Chronic atrial fibrillation, history of mitral valve repair
Active problems:
Focal motor neuropathy
2. Foot drop, night
3. Mediastinal adenopathy
4. Family history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
5. Other persistent atrial fibrillation (HCC)
History of Present illness:
is a 59 y.o. right-handed man with a past medical history significant
for mitral valve repair
due to severe mitral regurgitation, likely congenital, prior
pulmonary hypertension, chronic atrial fibrillation and presumed pulmonary sarcoidosis, who is
referred in neurological consultation regarding recent history of right more than left lower
extremity weakness.
The patient and his wife report that his symptoms started gradually, but rapidly progressive, in
of this year. At first, his wife noticed that he had an unusual gart, almost dragging his
right foot and shuffling. By late , he had a considerable difficulty with the right foot and
an almost complete right foot drop, to the point that he had to quit his job as a driver for waste
management. There was no pain and he does not recall any sensory symptoms at onsel.
The weakness has continued progressively since then. He has complete paralysis of the right
foot, but he also has increasing weakness with the proximal right lower extremity. When
specifically questioned, he also endorses mild weakness of the left leg and also mild weakness
of the hands, evident by not being able to open jars. Also when specifically asked, he reports
loss of muscle bulk in both legs, more on the right. He is not aware of muscle twitches,
although he endorses occasional cramps of the right foot. The process continues to be
painless. There is also no significant sensory involvement, with exception of a recent history
(last week or so) of dysesthesia of the dorsum of the right foot. He required a lightweight right
AFO and he is now walking with a rolling walker, but ambulation is becoming increasingly
effortful.
He is not aware of proximal upper extremity or bulbar weakness, although his wife finds his
speech occasionally slow and mildly abnormal No difficulty chewing or swallowing. No double
vision.
The patient had numerous recent imaging studies. On , he had an MRI scan of the
lumbosacral spine without contrast, which showed mild to moderate degenerative changes at
the 13-4 and L4-5 level, with a mild central disc protrusion at L3-4 and mild bilateral foraminal
narrowing, but without entrapment of the nerve root. I performed electrodiagnostic studies of
the right lower extremity on and the study showed severe denervation predominantly in
the right L.5 dermatome, spreading into the paraspinal muscles. Of note, he also had milder
denervation in the right vastus medialis. Since L5 radiculopathy was suspected, he had
another MRI scan of the lumbosacral spine with and without contrast on
which did
not show any new abnormality and no contrast enhancement. The patient was also referred
for MRI scan of the brain on
and thoracic spine with and without contrast on
and both studies were generally unremarkable, no evidence of parenchymal or
meningeal enhancement. Negligible punctate gliosis of the hemispheres on the MRI scan of
the brain and normal cord on MRI of the thoracic.
The patient's care so far has been coordinated by who also referred the patient to
where he has an appointment in
Generally, the patient has a prior diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis, which was made in
At that time, the patient had significant shortness of breath, which ultimately was attributed to
CHF related to mitral regurgitation (subsequently improved after he had mitral valve repair).
However, CT scan of the chest in showed numerous nodules and a biopsy through
bronchoscopy showed that one of the nodules had changes consistent with noncaseating
granuloma Sarcoidosis was suspected and he received a short course of steroid, without
benefit. The patient had another follow-up CT scan in
which was unchanged. :
He was followed by Dr. | for a while, but until recently he did not have another follow-up
CT scan.
In
he had mitral valve repair and subsequently he was diagnosed with atrial
fibrillation, he is now anticoagulated. His respiratory problems improved considerably.
this year, he had another CT scan of the chest, which again showed numerous lung
nodules (according to a subsequent note from Dr it was probably not significantly
different from The patient was also referred for PET/CT, which is interpreted as
probably consistent with neoplasm versus sarcoidosis. The patient was evaluated by Dr.
is a virtual appointment.
Given his diagnosis of sarcoidosis and the recent neurological problems, neurosarcoidosis was
considered and the patient received 2 short course of steroids (initially prednisone, then
dexamethasone), with no benefit and further progression.
All imaging studies reviewed.
The patient has a family history of ALS (2 maternal aunts, who died in their 80s), which was
reported at the end of the interview by his wife.
Patient has an otherwise unremarkable neurological history, with exception of a brief episode of
transient visual loss following the open heart surgery
At that time, a CT
angiogram was unremarkable.

Chief Complaint
Patient is here for tingling and numbness in lower extremities.
History Of Present Illness
Dear
MD, I had the pleasure of seeing
consultation today at your request.
a 82 year old White male ,in neurologic
This is a pleasant gentleman who is here today because of a progressive history of lower extremity weakness, foot
drop, and paresthesias. He notes that he feels numb from his proximal legs all the way down into his feet. He has
progressively had difficulty with walking. His family describes his foot slapping when he walks and catching his foot
in his walker. She is concerned that this is going to make it very difficult for him to ambulate. He did have a lot of
back pain and has had surgery at the L5 level many years ago but that back pain has gotten better recently. He has
difficulty grasping objects with his hand. His family member again describes for example that forks are difficult for
him to manipulate and often he will drop them. He has persistent numbness to the point of pain sometimes
particularly in the right lower extremity. No recent fevers, chills or rashes and no injury.

Chief Complaint
Follow up fter IVIg.
History Of Present Illness
I had the pleasure of seeing
a 82 year old White male ,in neurologic follow up.
The patient did well with IVIg in terms of his strength, his balance is better; he can stand up unassisted where he
was unable to do this prior to the treatment. He feels the strength in his feet is a little better and his daughter
notices that he manipulates utensils while eating better than he had previously. Unfortunately he did develop a
cellulitis in his left arm he was treated with antibiotics and that has cleared up. There was no clot on ultrasound
when he was evaluated.

Dear
Today, I saw your patient.
and met his wife in
Clinic for followup on
his clinical progress. You would recall that I first saw him on
for suspected motor
neuron disease. He has undergone electromyographic examination and I reviewed the findings. It showed
evidence of ongoing denervation and reinnervation changes in multiple anatomic territories, compatible
with early MND. However, there is also suggestion of motor conduction block in radial nerve on the right
side. In addition, there is minor sensory conduction abnormalities, unusual in MND.
He reports to me that his overall neurological deficit is about the same as it was in October of this year.
The details of his findings are entered in our electronic health record.
In view of his young age, focal atrophy, and EMG findings, he should undergo immunomodulatory therapy
in an attempt to reverse his neurological deficit.
I am writing this brief note regarding IVIG infusion therapy in him. Our suspicion is that he may have
multifocal motor neuropathy or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. I had a
lengthy discussion with him. We will begin IVIG infusion therapy at 0.4 g/kg body weight per day for 5
consecutive days followed by 2-day infusion therapy every 2 weeks for the next 3 months. It will address
the potential reversibility of his neuromuscular syndrome. I am asking my office to arrange IVIg therapy
for hm. I believe he requires a immunoregulatory therapy before the case be signed up as motor neuron
disease. He had many questions, which I was happy to answer. I will be happy to see him in followup in 2
months' time. Once again, I take this opportunity to thank you for letting me see your patient and be
involved in his clinical care.
Many thanks and best wishes.

CC: right hand weakness
HPL:
Mr.
is a 50 year old gentleman who comes for follow up for right hand
weakness. He noticed about 8 months ago while he was refereeing for a sports team
that he was having trouble completely extending the fingers of his right hand. He was
referred to this clinic for evaluation in October. At that time, he was noted to have
asymmetric atrophy of forearm and hand muscles, mainly on the right, as well as
fasciculations. In addition, he had some tingling of the fourth and fifth digits of the right
hand and pain at the wrist on the dorsal aspect. EMG/NCS was done in November, and
showed conduction block at the radial nerve at the forearm and sensory abnormalities at
the wrist which may be attributable to carpel tunnel syndrome. Patient returns today,
and states he has no more tingling of the fingers or pain of the wrist, and is no longer
taking gabapentin or tramadol. He does not notice any other areas of weakness.
ROS: negative for fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, urinary sypmtoms.
All other ROS negative expt for as per hpi
Exam:
CN: PERRL, EOMI, no nysgtamus, no facial weakness, no sensory abnormalities, no
hearing problems, tongue midline, uvula midline
Motor: atrophy of hand, fasciculations in th ehand, weakness on the right in the finger
extensors 2-3/5, abductor pollicis brevis 2/5, wrist ext 4+/5, flexors of fingers, wrist 5/5,
biceps and triceps 5/5. Left side abductor pollicis brevis 3/5, otherwise 5/5. Lower
extremities 5/5.
Reflex: 2+ troughout, toes downgoing
Sensory: intact to LT and temperature
Gait: normal
Romberg: negative
Assessment/Plan:
The patient has atrophy and weakenss of the distal extremities greater on the right than
left with EMG/NCS suggestive motor neuron disease. Ddx includes MMN or CIDP.
Patient will be referred for home infusion of IVIG.

is a 50 y.o. male.
HPI
Patient comes after having undergone EMG.
Some atypical features for MND and these include
-Conduction block at radial nerve
-Sensory abnormalities
However, features including progression, short history, fasciculations, diffuse neurogenic
changes and normal F wave latencies suggest MND.
A letter is dictated to Dr.
and copied to patient.
The patient was seen with neromuscular fellow and the clinic visit and evaluation was
supervised by me. The history was reviewed and clinical examination ascertained. I concur with
the findings, plan of investigation, and management as detailed in the house-staff's report. After
discussing the history and clinical findings with the staff, I personally confirmed the key
elements in history and examination with the patient. The clinical diagnosis, the reasoning
behind the diagnosis, and the treatment options were discussed with patient. Enough time and
opportunity for patient questions was given and all questions were addressed. I spent about 50
minutes in case discussion, out of which 50% was spent in counseling.

recovering quite well and had virtually no symptoms until the summer came and he noticed with increasing
temperature that he started to have similar symptoms that he did during the onset of his GBS. He had
weakness and tingling in the legs but after cooling down he did not feel that he returned to baseline. He also
noticed that he seemed to be sweating more than usual. He still occasionally gets dysesthesias and he
occasionally has felt like his knees are buckling. He has stumbled when walking but he has not fallen. He is
having difficulty opening jars and has seemed to occasionally been dropping things from his hands. There is
no bowel or bladder changes, no dysphagia or diplopia.
No current outpatient prescriptions on file.

Assessment
This is a 23yo gentleman seen in follow up for GBS. His exam is essentially unchanged. His worsening
symptoms usually would not be concerning in the setting of warmer temperatures as this is usually simply
Uhthoff's phenomenon. While it is possible that his GBS is more related to a more chronic demyelinating
process, it is reassuring that his exam is unchanged. A more objective way to evaluate some of his
symptoms will be with electrodiagnostic testing.
Plan
Check Antiganglioside Ab panel
NCS/EMG
The patient was instructed to call with any problems or questions.
For all reported symptoms not discussed above the patient was referred to their primary medical doctor.

CC: tingling and numbness
HPI:
is a 63 y.o. female who presents for evaluation of distal extremity numbness and
paresthesia. Symptoms began in July 2013 with just burning sensation at the soles of the feet. Within
a week, tingling appeared in the distal fingertips. Since then paresthesia and numbness have
worsened and progressed. They are now present throughout whole feet bilaterally up to the knees, all
fingers (not just tips), hips and thighs. Symptoms have caused gait instability. She feels unsteady
when she stands. She has trouble walking up stairs and up hills. She has not fallen but sometimes
feels like she will stumble. She denies any preceding trauma, Gl, or URI illnesses,
She was evaluated by Dr.
neurology. An NCS/EMG showed diffuse moderate
sensorimotor mixed axonal and demyelinating polyneuropathy, concerning for a metabolic neuropathy.
She then underwent a glucose tolerance test which was normal. She was then referred to Dr.
rheumatology. She underwent a serologic work up consisting of ANA, vitamin B12, SPEP,
folate, TSH, CRP, FR, CBC, C3 and C4 levels - all unremarkable. She is referred her for further
evaluation.

Chief Complaint
calf weakness
History of Present Illness
71yo ambidextrous man with HTN, CAD, h/o prostate CA who presents for evaluation of tripping and falls that
began in Nov 2011, and significantly noticeable weakness in the calves since June 2012. He denies any sensory
symptoms and now has weakness in his left hand.
Interval history: He is here for follow-up and discussion of results and treatment options. No new symptoms since
his prior visit, but does feel that the weakness is continuing to progress in his feet and in his left hand. He denies
any double vision, difficulty swallowing, chewing, speaking or eating.

resection), with subacute onset of progressive weakness in the left-right feet and in the left hand, here for follow-up
and discussion of results and treatment plan. The pattern of weakness is asymmetric and distal, with minimal to no
sensory findings, both on exam and by EMG, all of which are consistent with multifocal motor neuropathy. Motor
neuron disease cannot be entirely excluded, but the lack of upper motor neuron signs argues against MND
(patellar reflexes are slightly brisker than on last visit, but Babinski is negative, Hoffmann's is negative, jaw Jerk is
negative, there is no clonus). In addition, CSF shows cytoabuminologic dissociation with protein elevated at
91mg/dL and no WBCs, and the serum laboratory studies reveal a positive antibody against Gd1a (2x ULN), a
ganglioside that is enhanced in the peripheral motor nerves and can be associated with MMN. The positive Mi-2
antibody is of uncertain significance, as this is seen in some myopathies, as well as in primary biliary cirrhosis.
While he does have mildly elevated CK (2x ULN) and LDH and aldolase which is consistent with a myopathy or
even distal hereditary muscular dystrophy, the EMG did not find any clear evidence for a myopathic process, but
rather, for a neurogenic process and the elevated muscle enzymes may be secondary to the neurogenic process.
Based on the clinical presentation and work-up, MMN is most likely, followed by possible myositis and less likely
MND. We discussed at length the treatment for MMN, which is Vig and we discussed the risks of infusion
reactions including mild headache and flu-like symptoms, rare risk of aseptic meningitis and thrombotic events, as
well as the likely benefits in the case of an immune-mediated neuropathy and in particular MMN. He had a TTE by
his cardiologist last week that shows no evidence for CHF, and he has no renal disease which would be relative
contraindications to IVlg. Mr. has given me explicit permission today to speak to their physician friend Dr.
regarding his condition and asked me to explain to him the diagnosis.
--start home IVlg, Induction dose of 0.5g/kg/day for 5days (95kg-->45g/d x5days)
--premedication with benadryl and tylenol
--cont to hold crestor for now

--send Athena lab for GD1a to differentiate IgM vs IgG vs IgA
--re-evaluate clinically in 1 month
Attending Attestation
more than 50% of this 40min visit was spent on counselling the patient regarding his diagnosis, the prognosis, the
treatment modality risk and benefits, as described above.

History of Present Illness
71yo ambidextrous man with HTN, CAD, h/o prostate CA who presents for evaluation of tripping and falls that
began in
and significantly noticeable weakness in the calves since
With mild exertion feels
tired and weak, but no pain, and no other part of the body. It began in the right leg, then to the left, and now left
thumb weakness as well. Weakness is most prominent when walking or exercising, but standing does not
exacerbate the weakness. Walking up set of stairs will feel very weak. There is no correlation with the time of day,
and no fluctuation. Denies cramping, twitches or pain. Wife notes that he has jerking movements at night when
asleep, but he is not aware of it. In August had swelling of the right lower leg that has persisted (noted to be 2in
larger than the left). Is wearing compression stockings, but no improvement, and has been doing PT with no
improvements. His cardiologist suggested stopping the crestor which he did a few weeks ago. Denies numbness,
tingling, back pain, neck pain. Denies double vision, blurry vision, difficulty speaking, swallowing. Lost 1lb per
month for past 4 months. Notes increasing sweating for past 6 months.

Reference Range:

Positive: 1:10 titer
Antibodies to myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) are
associated with neuropathies with IgM paraproteinemia.
50% of patients with this form of neuropathy have
anti-MAG antibodies. The presence of anti-MAG antibodies
is also suggestive of active demyelination in a
peripheral neuropathy. Anti-MAG antibodies are usually
not associated with axonal neuropathies.

Positive => 1
The detection of SGPG -IgM antibodies are associated
with peripheral neuropathy. Majority of the SGPG
antibody positive patients will also be positive for MAG
antibodies. SGPG positive cases in the absence of
anti-MAG, IgM, antibodies may suggest a multi-focal
motor neuropathy with conduction block. The absence of
SGPG -IgM antibodies does not rule out peripheral
neuropathy. In such cases with peripheral neuropathy
anti-MAG IgM antibodies testing can be considered as
anti-MAG antibody may be positive in the absence of SGPG antibodies.

Complaint:
Pt. here for follow-up, Dx: HIV+, Hepatitis C, and Chronic Intractable Pain due to HIV Neuropathy /
CIDP.
Patient is having problems with his disability, he was recently denied his long term disability. The
letter he received stated that his plan's medical doctor did not receive a phone call from myself
eventhough I made the call in front of
The denial letter states that
because his CD4 count is high and his HIV Viral Load is undetectable and the pt. has no outward
signs of disability that he did not meet the criteria. I clearly told Dr.
that ""there was not
one thing that made Donald disabeled and unable to work but rather through the summation of his
ailments"". They provide no evidence that the pt. is not as aflicted as he / I say he is.
While his HIV is well controlled he still continues to suffer from chronic severe incapacitating fatigue,
diarrhea not to mention the chronic intractible pain as a result of the inflammatory effect of the HIV.
Pt. continues to have bilateral lower extremity neuropathic pain, decreased sensation, allodynia,
hyperalgesia, numbness and tingling.
Psychologically he is very upset and he will lose a significant amount of income.
He has since had panic attacks and suicidal thoughts.
He does not have a plan however.
No firearms in the home.
Pt. does feel as if he has had some reactionary depression as a result.
Leery of starting SSRI', SNRI's etc..
But panic and crying spells cause increased pain so they must be addressed.

Review / Management
Results review
Impression and Plan
has symptoms and signs of a generalized polyneuropathy and EMGs which reveals a severe
demyelinating polyneuropathy.
It is my opinion that the degree of his neuropathy is far out of proportion to what one would expect from diabetes.
Given the mild proximal muscle weakness in his lower extremities, areflexia throughout, sensory loss in his feet, an
EMG findings, I believe he has CIDP he has a cause for his neuropathy.
I discussed this at great length with the patient.
I recommended that we proceed with IVIG as treatment for his CIDP, 0.4 g per kilogram given in 5 consecutive
doses, followed by the same dosage biweekly for the next 3 months.
We will contact his insurance company for approval before starting treatment.
He will be followed regularly during treatment and repeat EMGs will need to be performed to evaluate treatment.

PATIENT:
DOB:
MRN No:
The patient is in the office for a followup appointment. He has completed a sympathetic
sensory response which came back abnormal with a prolonged latency consistent with
autonomic sensory neuropathy. The patient also has completed the biopsy of the skin
which shows significantly reduced number of small fibers in the sweat gland. It is also
consistent with the autonomic sensory fiber neuropathy and the patient will require
additional laboratory studies for that. In the meantime, he went to a rheumatologist
complaining to him of a joint pain mostly in his knees, ankles, and toes and he was
initially treated with the prednisone, but that was not really effective. He also received
injection with the cortisone and that also did not make significant difference. Apparently,
rheumatologist did not believe the patient needs TNF distributors although I was thinking
that he might have signs of early psoriatic arthritis that is not the case.
The patient comes in. He continues to use Celebrex 200 mg daily and Percocet 10/325
mg usually two tablets daily for pain. He continues to complain of a sensory disturbances
and sensation of cold and that is in his extremities as well as persistent pain affecting his
joints.
NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:
The patient is alert, oriented, and fluent. He has normal cranial nerves. Coordination is
without ataxia. He has a full strength in the upper and lower extremities, the intrinsic
muscles, opponens of the thumbs, biceps, triceps, deltoids, iliopsoas, hamstring, tibialis
anterior, and posterior are having a full strength. He does have variable vibration sensory
deficit.
Page 2
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Small fiber autonomic neuropathy.
PLAN:
1. We will refer this patient to complete anti-ganglionic acetylcholine receptor
antibody.
2. We will start treatment with the IVIG immunoglobulins 2 grams/kg divided for 5
days on a monthly basis. I recommended trial with this medicine.
3. The patient will then follow up in my office again in six weeks.

hospital. She was sent home with erythromycin but developed
diarrhea and increased fatigue 24 hours later. She returned to the hospital
where she was given IV clindamycin and steroid treatment for COPD. She then
reports experiencing pins and needles and weakness of bilateral upper
extremities, which extended to her lower extremities bilaterally. She
presented to

Assessment/Plan Note: In Athena testing, was found to have significant increases in anti asialo GM1 antibodies.
This along with her progressively debilitating mptoms to include frequent falling, requiring the use of a walker for
half of the day to ambulate while in the previous months she was completely independant of ambulatory devices, as
well as progressively more bowel and bladder incontinence re quires IVIG therapy. Cyclophosphamide therapy was
considered but in weighing the risks of therapy with possible benefits it seems prudent to monitor response to
the IVIG therapy first. We will start therapy at 1000mg/kg of gammagard liquid human IVIG at the last recorded
weight of 118 pounds (53.64kg) for a dose of 53,640mg IV x's 2 days then itime every 3 weeks. We will then see
her for follow up at 6 weeks and then 12 weeks from the start of therapy for monitoring and evaluation. We will also
obtain a baseline comp and cbc, PT, PTT and then repeat this 3 after infusion.

Reason for Referral:
Bilateral hand and leg numbness - question polyneuropathy
Patient History and Exam:
yo woman regarding her history of paresthesias and pain involving the distal extremities. She states that she was diagnosed with
Guillain
-Barre syndrome inbased on lumbar puncture findings and 
she feels that she is having a recurrence of
symptoms. Exam reveals symmetrically 
decreased sensation to 
pin over the legs, forearms and hands, absent ankle jerks, and normalstrength.
EMG Suminary:
Procedures and potential risks of EMG testing are discussed with the patlent prior to obtaining her verbal consent to proceed. Whenavailable, normal values from age-matched controls are used for comparison. 
Studies are performed on both sides. Technical qualityof the study is good,
Temperature monitoring: Limb surface temperature is continuously monitored during the EMG exant. When necessary, hydroculatorwarming packs are utilized to maintain hand temperature >32 C and foot 
temperature >30 C. For this study, limb warning is noirequired.
Nerve conduction studies (NCS): The right median and ulnar sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitudes are reduced. Theright sural and superficial peroneal SNAPs are within normal limits 
(WNL). The right median/thenar, ulnar/hypothenar,peronealVEDB, and tibial/AH motor NCSs are WNL..F-wave 
latencies are WNL. Bilateral tibial/soleus H-reflex latencies are absent.
Concentric needle electromyography (CNE): CNE reveals normal insertional activity, no abnormal spontaneous activity, nofibrillations or positive sharp waves, no fasciculation 
potentials or myotonic discharges, and normal recruitment of motor unit actionpotentials (MUAP) in all muscles examined.
EMG Interpretation:
Abnormal study The electrodiagnostic finding of low amplitude median and ulnar sensory responses is non-specific in regards tolocalization. These findings are not in associated with median 
or ulnar nerve compression or entrapment (e.g., carpal tunnelsyndrome). Coupled with the history and physical 
examination, this study is suggestive of a length-independent sensorypolyneuropathy

G-ACHR autoantibodies have been strongly associated with acute and
subacute (< 6 months) pandysautonomia, typically presenting with
orthostatic hypotension, gastrointestinal dysmotility and other autonomic
impairment. 14 Importantly, a positive G-ACHR autoantibody test
indicates that the autonomic deficits may be responsive to
imminomodulatory therapy. Although not highly predictive of
malignancy, G-ACR autoantibodies may be found in patients with
underlying small-cell lung cancer, thymoma, or other cancers.
Neurological symptoms may precede the detection of the occult
carcinoma so monitoring is recommended, and a search for occult cancer
should be considered in this setting.

Progress Notes
RE:
I saw
in the office for a follow up. She is a 53 year old female with Orthostatic
with
Intolerance,somatic hypervigilance and dysautonomia. Patient was last seen on
the following:
Impression:
1) Orthostatic Intolerance
2) somatic hypervigilance
3) dysautonomia
Comment:
She has a large number of primary symptoms (29 on her list) suggestive of somatic hypervigilance.
I dont find any abnormalities on neurologic exam and her orthostatic BP is normal. The midodrine
and florinef are controlling the orthostatics, but overall feels only about 50% of her full function. It is
possible that she developed an autoimmune syndrome that decompensated her previous
autonomic dysfunction from 2007. The DDx includes pure autonomic failure, autonomic neuropathy,
post viral pandysautonomia, autoimmune dysautonomia, and POTS.
Deconditioning is a common contributor to autonomic disability.
The treatment includes volume expansion, exercise, and medication. Critical to success is a
lifestyle change that includes vigorous daily exercise and weight training of the legs, to restore
venous return.
I recommend the following:
1) tilt test and autonomic studies
2) 20-30# knee high stockings
3) abdominal binder to be worn while standing and prn
4) 1.5-2 liters water daily
5) thermotabs 2-4 daily. The goal is to gain between 3-6 pounds of water weight.
6) obtain a HR monitor.
7) begin a graded exercise program 2-4 days per week with a recumbent bicycle, swimming or
rowing machine.
8) do 10 minutes of warm up
9) then do 20-40 minutes of vigorous activity to maintain HR at 80% of maximum.
10) 80% max can be calculated using the following--(220 - age) x 0.8
12) after 2 weeks, increase to 5-7 days per week
13) add weight lifting with modest weights to your regimen
14) after 1-3 months, begin to introduce gravity sports- running, treadmill, spinning classes, etc.
15) AchR-ganglionic antibody
16) hold florinef 3 days, midodrine 1 day before testing
Since her last visit she continues to have problems as she only feels about 25 % improved since all
of her Sx started. She has been trying to work out but if she does 30 minutes of exercise she is
worn out to the point it is difficult to even move. Patient is here today to discuss her tests results.
Patient states she feels completely exhausted on the days she works out. Patient states she could
be sitting in the chair and her HR can be high 103 or when she is walking in the house it can go up
Page 1 of 7

IMPRESSION:
1. Autoimmune Autonomic Neuropathy
2. Hashimotos thyroiditis
3. orthostatic hypotension
Comment:
The autonomic testing shows a CASS score of 10, c/w severe autonomic failure affecting
cholinergic and adrenergic function.
I have communicated with Dr
regarding a clinical trial of IVIG.
She is poorly tolerant of exercise.
I recommend the following:
1) Continue recumbent bike 3-5 days per week.
2) Continue the compression stockings
3) Will await contact from
egarding IVIG study
More than half of 25 minutes was spent discussing the pathophysiology and treatment of the above
medical issues and all questions were answered.
I will plan to see
again in 3 months.

History of Present Illness
The patient is a year old male who presents to the practice today for a transition into care.
Additional reason for visit:
Numbness is described as the following:
Note for ""Numbness"": This is a year-old left-handed man with a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension, with a
chlef complaint of numbness involving the hands and feet. In 2001, he had a left hip replacement; upon awakening, he
noted numbness of all fingertips, which has gradually increased such that he has numbness bilaterally above the wrist,
Involving both sides of the hand. In 2005, he had a right hip replacement; Immediately after surgery he became aware of
numbness involving his toes, which has gradually increased to above the level of the ankles. He denies any associated pain,
including neck or back pain; he denles imbalance, including when he closes his eyes in the shower; there is been no
weakness or change in bladder or bowel functioning. He states that he's had elevated blood sugars for the past 5 or 6 years,
and approximately one year ago, went on metformin, which has helped for his glucose numbers. He states that the
numbness has been functionally disabling for him in that he is unable to golf, or use a keyboard, and his handwriting is
poor. He has not worked since had other blood tests such as a vitamin B12 level, but did have routine blood work about one
month ago; some years ago he saw Dr.
a neurology, and was told that he has carpal tunnel syndrome as well as
ulnar neuropathy. He is unsure of what type of anesthesia he actually had.

Chief Complaint
• PAIN IN HANDS, NUMBNESS AND TINGLING
Subjective
Dear Dr
Thank you for referring
for consultation regarding this history of hand weakness.
MI
is a year old man with a subacute onset of bilateral hand weakness and numbness since
He noted
increased numbness and tingling in the 4th and 5th digit of both hands that progressed in intensity. He also noted weakness bydifficulty grasping 
things. By
he was having hand pain and was developing finger contracture. He feel the symptoms are
better in the morning and worse as the day progress.
He has previous cervical and lumbar surgeries. The cervical C5-6 fusion was
of neck pain. The surgery did improved this pain, but only temporarily.
formed in
after he developed significant amount
Previous workup by Dr. neurologist in included MRI c-spine which showed evidence of C5-6 internal fixation withdouble harmonic 
curve putting stretch on the spinal cord w/o cord enhancement. MRI brain is normal. MRI I-spine showed evidenceof previous L5-S1 surgery 
and moderate to severe bilateral foraminal stenosis at this level and at L4-5. NCS/EMG performed onshowed sensory and 
motor abnormalities with demyelinating and axonal features in the median and ulnar nerves bilaterally.

Assessment
Mr.
subacute clinical presentation and neurological finding are consistent with sensory and motor peripheral nerve
involvement. Per previous NCS performed in an outside laboratory, the neuropathy seems demyelinating and axonal making a variant
of CIDP a possible diagnosis, more specifically MADSAM as it has its onset in the hands. The hyperreflexia in the arms and legs
could be explained by his spinal stenosis. Another possibility could be motor neuron disease, but this is less likely as he has sensory
involvement,
Plan:
1. Schedule for NCS/EMG
2. Will plan for a trial of IVIG following the electrodiagnostic testing.

SUMMARY
After identifying the patient in the waiting room and reviewing all appropriately
available medical records, the patient was taken back to the examination room
where the procedure was explained, the sites of examination were noted, the
patient's questions were answered and the patient's verbal consent for the
procedure was obtained. Studies were performed using a CareFusion Synergy EMG
System.
Nerve conduction studies showed 34% conduction block of the left ulnar between
the elbow and wrist and 42% conduction block of the right ulnar motor response
between below the elbow and wrist. There was marked temporal dispersion left
median motor responses at proximal site. Bilateral median motor and right tibial
motor responses were prolonged in distal latencies. There was mild focal slowing
of bilateral ulnar motor across the elbows. Conduction velocities were slightly
slowed. The right peroneal motor response was absent recording over the EDB. But
has normal velocity recording over the anterior tibialis. The right median
sensory response was prolonged in distal latency. Right median and ulnar sensory

responses were borderline reduced in amplitude.
Needle examination showed fibrillalion polentials and positive sharp waves with
reduced recruitment of long duration, high amplitude and occasionally polyphasic
in right ulnar-proximal and distal innervated muscles and right median-proximal
and distal innervated muscles and in the peroneal and tibial innervated,
muscles.
CONCLUSION
Abnormal study. The findings are most consistent th bilateral median
neuropathies at the wrist and bilateral ulnar neuropathies across the elbow.
There is also evidence for right peroneal and tibial motor neuropathies. The
findings given the patient's pes cavus deformity could suggest hereditary
neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP). Alternatively the findings
could be related to an autoimmune process such as multifocal motor neuropathy
with conduction block (MMN) or a patchy demyelinating motor neuropathy.

climbing steps and stumbling while walking on the ocean. Last September
and October 2011, he noticed that he started dragging his feet and
falls. He has intermittent numbness in the ankles and legs. The
patient had nerve conduction study and EMG done, which showed length
dependent sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy. He does not have
any autonomic dysfunction associated with his neuropathy. He denies
having any symptoms in the hands. He has no neck or back pain,
but endorses pain in the shouldesr and arms. He reports losing
muscle bulk in the last 5 years. He has pain in the shoulders on
and off. He has stiffness in his muscle in the morning. He has
action and postural tremor of bilateral upper extremity.

Date/Time:
Chief Complaint/Consultation: RLE weakness
HPI:
male who is referred to neuromuscular clinic for evaluation of RLE weakness. Pt states that he has had
slow progression of his right leg weakness and numbness for 25+ years. He states that he felt that he noticed some
numbness in his foot that eventually migrated up his calf and leg over about 2-3 years. He now notices atrophy and
weakness which also started in the foot and calf and to a lesser extent in the proximal leg. He has had several spine
images that have not revealed his etiology. He had a EMG/NC in that was ""normal"" per report but when the
numbers are looked at closer did show abnormalities. He comes to clinic as he feels that there has been accelerated
weakness of his leg over the past 2-3 years and now he is having difficulty walking up stairs, getting out of a chair,
and walking long distances.
No other limb involvement. No saddle anesthesia. No bowel or bladder changes. It not on a statin.
Prior Workup:
EMG/NC- in our system was ""normal"" but his sural sensory was decreased on review.
Multiple L-spine MRI that have not shown an etiology for his symptoms.

Chief Complaint
Follow up on testing.
History Of Present Illness
I had the pleasure of seeing
a 81 year old White male , In neurologic follow up.
The patient continues in physical therapy, he feels it makes a little bit a difference but overall he still feels quite
weak and walking is a major challenge. Since last seen he had a lumbar puncture at the hospital and in the CSF
demonstrated elevated glucose and a protein of 110 with normal cells.

The combination of marked weakness and a neuropathy on nerve conduction's along with the elevated protein in his
cerebral spinal fluid of 110 is highly suggestive of the diagnosis of CIDP. While it is possible that the degenerative
changes in his lumbosacral spine had elevated his protein, his level is higher than I typically see for this condition.
We discussed the pros and cons as well as the risks and benefits of IV IG treatment and I gave him a handout both
on CIDP and IV IG to review.
I think the benefits far outweigh the risk for him and so we will start him on a five day course of IV IG. Will check an

essentially normal (Nov 2014 BUN 37 with normal creat and GFR), we'll start a five day course of treatment every

protein study, and parathyroid hormone. The serum calcium level was elevated at 10.8 mg/dl (upper limit normal 10.1
mg/dl). I discussed the elevated calcium with Mrs. She has previously been found to have calcium elevated. In
view of the normal PTH level, I do not think this has significance regarding her muscle weakness. I indicated that we can
further investigate this with additional laboratory testing if she would like. She did not express the wish to go further with
evaluating this. We can keep this in mind if we plan other lab tests in the future.
I reviewed the cervical spine MRI study with Mrs. and her husband. This showed degenerative disc changes at
several levels with disc osteophyte complexes at C4-5 and C5-6 creating spinal stenosis with loss of anterior and
posterior CSF signal which was maximal at C5-6 where there was also a posterior contribution to the stenosis due to
ligamentum hypertrophy. There was no evidence of cord deformation or abnormal cord signal at any level. Foraminal
stenosis was present at these same levels: This was interpreted by the radiologist as moderate on the right and mild on
the left at C4-5, and moderate to severe on the left and mild on the right at C5-6.
I reviewed the MRI results and the correlation of the MRI findings and her clinical and EMG findings. I indicated that her
clinical examination and EMG results could not be fully explained by the MRI findings alone, because she clearly has
muscle weakness and EMG abnormalities in muscles that have C7, C8, and T1 innervation and these levels do not show
involvement on the MRI. In addition, there were also abnormalities on the EMG study involving the thoracic paraspinal
muscles. Thus, although the MRI study is abnormal, it cannot explain her clinical presentation. In spite of this, I think the
abnormalities in the cervical spine are significant. I do not think the spine abnormalities are severe enough that she
should have surgical intervention, but I pointed out that she should absolutely avoid cervical spine manipulation and she
should avoid activities that might cause excessive or repetitive flexion extension movements of the spine. This is because
of the narrowing at the C5-6 level with loss of the protective CSF barrier and the possibility that such activities might
directly transmit impact to the spinal cord.
Assessment and Plan:
1. Progressive distal upper extremity weakness
I reviewed my diagnosis and treatment recommendations with Mrs. and her husband. Her clinical features are
most suggestive of multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN). Although she does not have anti-GM1 antibodies or conduction
block on the nerve studies, many patients with MMN do not have these features. I reviewed the fact that MMN can
respond to immunotherapy with IVIG, and I recommend that she undergo a 3 month trial of IVIG to determine if she
responds to this. The dose I recommend in 2 gm/kg given in divided doses once monthly for three months. To begin the
treatment, I recommend the dose is divided as 0.4 gm/kg/day for 5 days. I discussed the potential side effects of IVIG and
that I prescribe pre-treatment with Benadryl and naproxen to minimize side effects of headache. I also indicated that
many side effects are related to the rate of infusion and we will begin with a slow infusion rate and see how she tolerated
increases in the rate. I discussed her preference for beginning the IVIG therapy and she indicated that she would prefer
to have this done close to home. I will look into the options for arranging this for her and let her know. Because of the
cost of IVIG, I recommend that she request pre-approval by her insurance company. We briefly discussed the possibility
that she might not respond to IVIG. If that should be the case, then we will reconsider the possibility of motor neuron
disease. For the present time, I recommend that we put that possibility aside and focus on the hope that she will have a
good response to IVIG. I reviewed the time frame for recovery, and indicated that this would be a slow process. Although
Page: 10/16
she could begin to note improvement within the first week of IVIG therapy, I would give at least 3 months of therapy before
making a conclusion about her ability to respond.
2. Cervical spinal stenosis and foraminal stenosis
As above, I advised avoiding manipulation of the cervical spine and avoiding activities that cause excessive or repetitive
flexion extension movements of the cervical spine.
3. Anxiety
She should continue the citalopram.
4. Follow-up
My office will be in touch with her regarding arrangements for IVIG treatment. I would like her to call my office if she has
any problems related to the IVIG treatment. I would also like her to call if she begins to note any improvement in her
function. I will plan to see her for follow-up in about 3 months.

Impression
This is an abnormal study that gives evidence to suggest a L - Peroneal neuropathy at Fibular head. In addition there was
evidence to suggest an underlying predominantly demyelinating polyneuropathy c/w ber h/o of CIDP. Full report is below,
Clinical correlation is advised. Refer to PT and for AFO bracing. Pt understands and is in agreement.
Plan
1. Motor NCSS of the Left Peroneal nerve revealed normal dl and cvs in the lower leg (59 m/s) but slowing across the
fibular head (46 m/s) with a slight drop in CMAP amplitudes on stimulation above the fibular head (2.9 mv) compared to
below the fibular head (5 mv). Motor NCSs of the Right Peroneal and Tibial nerves bilaterally prolonged dls (R- Peroneal
7.1 msec and Tibial R- 6.7 msec and L-7 msec), slowed cvs (32-40 m/s) and small CMAP amplitudes (R- Peroneal-4.6
mV and Tibial R- 5.3 mV and L- 5 mV). Femoral motor NCss bilaterally revealed absent CMAPs. L- Median, Ulpar and
Radial antidromic sensory NCSs revealed prologed dls (Median 4.8 msec, Ulnar 4.7 msec and Radial 5 msec), slowed
cvs(34-42 m/s) and small SNAP amplitudes.
2. Peroneal and Tibial F waves were prolonged (56-60 msec) and impersistent with greater than 40 % drop out rate. H-
reflexes were absent bilaterally. Left Median and Ulnar were prolonged (34-40 insec) with mild impersistênce.
3. Sural and Lateral Femoral sensory NCSs bilaterally revealed absent SNAPS. L- Median, Ulanr and Radial antidromic
sensory NCSS revealed prolonged dls ( Median 3.7 ms, Ulnar 3.6 ms and Radial 3.9 ms), slowed cvs (34-40 m/sec) and
small SNAP amplitudes.

Chief Complaint
• CC: CIPD w/ paralysis and numbness
HPI
HOPI: Mr
patient with CIDP w/ profound weakness and paralysis. He also has severe numbness,
proprioceptive loss.
Since his last appt, he had been scheduled for IVIG, but he did not receive it b/c no one at the cancer center orhisinsurance 
could tell him his out of pocket costs and he cannot afford a signficant co-pay.
Since last appt, I had ordered PWC for immobility and safety. He did have hte PWC seating assessment, but has notheard from a 
mobility company.
The pt's labs (last set in Sept) were stable,
He had MRI C spine to evaluate cervical cord andthis showed the remote injury and prior fusion but no new changes,
no new compression.
He cannot ambulate safely, he cannot cut his food by himelf. He denies SOB. No new problems. He cannot get out
the house independently and therefore does not leave the house. He could not get out of the house w/o assistance.
he denies any decubitus ulcers, denies any skin breakdown. No choking.

Report of EMG and Nerve Conduction Studies
Reason for Referral:
Patient with unsleadiness of gait. NCV and EMG studies needed to identify peripheralneuropathy
Referring Physician:
EMG Consultant:
Temperature (Dorsum of foot/hand); 30.5° C
Description of Results:
Right median distal motor latency is borderline normal, with low amplitude evoked responses and normal segmental velocity.Right ulnar distal motor latericy is normal, with low amplitude 
evoked responses and normal segmental velocities between thedistal arm and wrist. Right tibial distal motor latency is 
borderline prolonged, with markedly reduced evoked responseamplitudes and mildly slow segmental velocities. There 
is no evoked response elicitable from the right peroneal. Recordingfrom the right tibialis anterior, evoked response 
amplitudes are low, segmental velocities are normal, and distal latencies arenormal. F-response latencies are normal in the median 
and ulnar, but absent in the tibial and peroneal.
Sensory evoked responses are absent in the right sural, using both antidromic and orthodromic reporting methods. There isno sensory response recording from the superficial 
peroneal. Median and ulnar sensory velocities are normal, with lowamplitude evoked responses. Right radial sensory 
conduction velocity is normal, with low amplitude evoked response. H-reflexes are absent in the right tibial.
Needle EMG of selective muscles in both legs shows spontaneous activity in the form of fibrillation potentials and positivesharp waves, with reduced recruitment on submaximal effort 
in all muscles tested, and markedly increased duration inamplitude in all muscles tested,
Conclusion:
The electrophysiologic findings revealed the presence of a diffuse sensory motor peripheral neuropathy, primarily axonal innature. Clinical correlation is required.

This panel of tests did not identify any positive results.
Comments: The likelihood that this individual's clinical symploms are associated with these antibodioa has boon reduced. However, this
test rasull does not rule cut an autoimmune etiology for the neurological symptoms associated with paripheral neuropathy.
If the SGPC and/or MAG ELISA is postlive or inconclusive in the context of a negative MAG Weslom blot the result in considered
negative.
Recommendations: Health care providers, placas contact the Athana Diagnostics Client Services Department at 1-800-904-4403 If you
wish to consult with a Laboratory Director regarding this last res
Background informan: Peripheral couropathies (PNS) are a group of neurological disorders effecting one or more of the poripheral
nerves, Counca of PN include nerve compression, genelic mutations, Inflammation, metabolic abnormalities, vitamin deficiencias,
exponure to toxins or drugs, or the presence of autoimmune antibodies. Symptoms of PN vary based on location and mechanism of nerve
damage but can include sensory Impairment, distal weakness, loss of sensation, muscle weaknes, and pain. PN are typically dessified
based on the lypen of nerves affected, predominantly motor, predominantly sensory, or a combination of both.
For a more detailed review of peripheral neuropathy, please refer to Andreoli et al. (2007) Codil Essentialc of Medicina. 7th ed. Saunders
Elsevier. (ISBN-13: 978-1-4160-2933-5) and Latov, N. (2007) Peripheral Neuropathy: When the Numbres, Woaknese and Pain Won't
Stop. AAN prosa (15BN-13: 978-1-992603-59-0)
ELISA method: Delection of antibodies was performed by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Apssy (ELISA) methodology. Detection of
GALOP autoantibodies was determined by the evaluation of foM antibodies to GSC (a physiologic combination of GM1, Sulfatide, and
cholesterol), GGC (a physiologie combination GM1, galactocerebroside and cholesterol) and Histone antigens Individually. Elevated
levels of IgM antibodies to GSC are considered specific for GALOP when the levels of GGC and Histono antibodies falls within the normal
reference range. An elevated lovel of GSC antibodies in the context of an elevated GGC, and/or Histone is considered polyreactive (
false positive for GALOP syndrome). False positive results are denoted with an materiak in the interpretive results table,
ELISA with western blot confirmation method: Datection of antibodies was performed by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Antay
(ELISA) and confirmed by western blot methodology.
Limitations of ELISA and western blot analysis: The westem blot method uses denaturing/reducing electrophoresis and as a result,
may not detect conformational antibodies. Consequently, this methodology can only discriminate between presence and absence of non-
conformational antibodies targeted against the antigon. Variable transfer rates and reagent effectiveness may affect the signal Intensity
of the response. Affinity of individuals antibodies for this antigen cannot be measured using this methodology. Therefore western blot
results provided are purely qualliative. If antigens are cloned in E. cos, individuals with E. coli infections may exhibit falsa positive rosuto.
Specimen type may affect sonsllvity and specificity of this assay. Although rare, falso positive or falso negative recull me out
results should be interpreted in the context of clinical findings, relevant history, and other laboratory den,

SEX: F
History: Ms.
is a 42-year-old right-handed woman who, about 14 months
ago, developed weakness in the left hand with difficulty extending the fingers. This
happened insidiously. The first thing she noticed was trouble typing. After that it started
to ""lock up,"" her wrist would get stuck in a flexed position. It then became more
apparent that she could not extend the fingers or wrist well. It was getting slowly worse.
There was some aching in the forearm, but pain was not a prominent complaint. She
had only occasional paresthesias, which were always too transient to even localize.
She was not sure which fingers were more affected. She could move the hand, but she
has noted increasing impairment in her ADLs. She has trouble writing or picking up
objects. She thought she was slightly weaker now than six months ago. She
occasionally had fasciculations in the left forearm. Today she noted throbbing
discomfort in the left anterior shoulder and elbow.
For probably two years, she has had some left suprascapular pain intermittently. This
was not a prominent complaint. The right hand was asymptomatic. She did note in the
last few months the left arm tended to get colder than the right more easily. There was
no trouble with her walking, speech, swallowing, or breathing.
She had an MRI of her cervical spine, which was available for review. This showed a
small central disc herniation at C5/6, which did not compress the spinal cord. There
was no myelomalacia. There was only mild foraminal stenosis at this level bilaterally.
The following blood tests were normal or negative: Lyme ELISA, ESR, ANA,
rheumatoid factor, SMA-20, and B12. C-reactive protein was elevated 10.4, cutoff less
than 5. She had an MRI of her brain, which was normal. She had an EMG at|
on
This was suggestive of chronic neurogenic process
affecting multiple nerves in the left arm. A brachial plexus lesion principally affecting the
posterior medial cord was favored. There was superimposed mild left ulnar neuropathy
at the elbow. There was an absent left medial cutaneous response, the right was

normal. Sensory conductions were otherwise normal. She was referred to see if the
posterior interosseous neuropathy predominated since weakness conformed to this
distribution.
Past Medical History: No diabetes or thyroid disease. No arthritis or tick bites. She
had fibroidectomy in 2010.
Drug Allergies: No known drug allergies.
Social History: No cigarette smoking. Drinks alcohol socially. She lives in a suburban
area in
there are deer.
Occupation: She does clerical work.
Family History: Maternal grandmother with breast cancer and diabetes. She did not
know the father's side well.
Medications: None.
Review of Systems: Occasional word finding difficulty. No dyspnea or dysarthria.
She did report unusual physical activity a couple of months before the weakness
started. She was in the process of a divorce, was under a lot of stress and had to do a
lot more yard work in terms of weeding, cutting the lawn, and lifting. She did think that
she exerted more force with her dominant right hand and the left hand was
symptomatic. She also noted that the weakness started at least two or three months
after this activity. All other systems were negative. No flu symptoms.
General Examination: Appearance: Overweight in no distress. Integument: No
dermatomal eruptions. Neck: Supple. Extremities: No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
No joint deformities in the hand or elbow.
Neurological Examination:
Mental Status: Alert. Fluent speech. No dysarthria.
Cranial Nerves: I through XII intact. No facial weakness. No Horner's syndrome
noted.
Motor: There was mild-to-moderate left ventral more than dorsal forearm atrophy.
There was only equivocal left FDI atrophy. There was normal thenar bulk. There was
tenderness of the posterior triceps in the mid humerus. No mass or Tinel sign.
Strength was graded as follows: left ECR 4, ECU 3, left EDC 2, thumb extensors 1,
R
P.008
Page 3
APB 2, FPL 5-, left FDP median 5-, left FDI 4+, but difficult to assess. Strength in the
right hand and legs were normal.
Gait: Normal including heel and toe walking.
Coordination: Finger-to-nose and tandem gait steady.
Sensory: Pin was diminished in L5 distribution in the legs. Pin was diminished in the
left superficial radial nerve and distal aspect of D3. There was also decreased pin in the
left medial forearm. Pin and vibration were otherwise intact.
Reflexes: Reflexes were 2+. Plantar responses were flexor bilaterally.
Electrophysiologic Findings: Bilateral median, radial, left ulnar and medial
antebrachial cutaneous responses were normal. Bilateral median and ulnar motor
conductions were normal. There was a suggestion of a right Martin-Gruber
anastomosis. The left radial motor response amplitude was borderline low distally.
There was borderline conduction block between the elbow and spiral groove and
between above spiral groove and Erb's point. There was diffuse slowing in the nerve.
There was no temporal dispersion. Bilateral median and ulnar F-wave minimal
latencies were normal,
Needle EMG of bilateral arms and left cervical paraspinal muscles showed fibrillations in
the left extensor indicis, biceps, and brachioradialis muscle. There were also
fibrillations and myokymia in the right extensor indicis muscle. There were long duration
polyphasic motor unit potentials that were prominent in left brachioradialis. There were
borderline long duration potentials in the left triceps and biceps. There was reduced
recruitment in the left biceps and brachioradialis. There was single unit recruitment in
the left extensor indicis.
Impression: There were multifocal motor nerve/axon abnormalities predominantly
affecting the left radial nerve proximal to the elbow, but also affecting the left
musculocutaneous nerve or upper trunk. In addition, there were active denervation
changes and myokymia in the right extensor indicis raising the possibility of additional
right posterior interosseous neuropathy.
Taken together, the clinical and electrophysiologic features are most suggestive of
multifocal motor neuropathy. A less likely explanation would be that the patient has left
greater than right posterior interosseous neuropathies with additional left C5/6
radiculopathy, but this is less likely. There were no sensory abnormalities to suggest a
brachial plexus localization in the left arm. Also there were no active denervation

Dear Sir/Madam:
This is a 52-year-old female with CIDP (ICD-9, 357.81) diagnosed at the
after a nerve root biopsy in The patient has had slowly
progressive pain, weakness and numbness involving the lower extremities
left greater than right. She had been fairly stable for the past few years until
recently when she has noted increasing gait imbalance, increasing atrophy of
the left leg and more difficulty standing. She is even having more difficulty
rolling over. She has been using a walker in her home, but crutches and a
wheelchair outside of her home. Her current MRI of the lumbosacral spine
reveals diffuse enhancement of the cauda equina.
Due to progression of CIDP (ICD-9, 357.81), I am recommending initiation
of IV Ig with an induction dose of 0.4 gm/kg daily for five days followed by
monthly maintenance doses of 0.4 mg/g for an additional five months and
then reevaluation. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there are any
questions.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 52-year-old female followed in my clinic for CIDP variant
manifested as an immune mediated lumbosacral polyradiculopathy involving the lower extremities left greater
than 
right
. Since the patient's last visit with me in )
she reports more intense sensation of numbness
involving the medial foreleg on the left and the distal right foot. Her balance is worse and that her left hip may
be weaker. She is having pain in the arches of both feet in addition to her baseline pain of left ankle, dorsal foot
and posterior leg. She is having more spasms in the ankle on the right and lateral shin, but no new numbness
and tingling on the right. She has more worrisome atrophy over the left knee. At home, she uses her walker
primarily, but out of the home for short distances she uses crutches and for long distances manual wheelchair.
She is having occasional incontinence of the bladder with urgency and bladder spasms, bladder spasms for two
to three times a day. She has been tried out on variety of medications by her urologist Dr
without
any change.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Blood pressure: 130/78. Pulse: 66. Weight: 221.0 pounds.
NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:
Motor: 5 diffusely in the upper extremity. Hip flexors 4+ on the right, 1+ on the left. Hip abductors 5 on the
right, 1+ on the left. Knce flexors 5/1+. Knee extensors, ankle dorsiflexors and plantar flexors 5 on the right
and 0 on the left. Extensors are 5- on the right, 0 on the left.
Reflexes: biceps, brachioradialis, triceps 2, knees 2 on the right, 0 on the left. Ankles trace on the right, 0 left.
Sensory: Decreased pinprick one third of the anterior foot and on the left side decreased pinprick of the lateral
foreleg up to the mid shin and medially the foreleg has diminished pinprick sensation to above the knee.
Vibrations: 7 seconds right large toe, 8 seconds left large toe.
IMPRESSION:
1. CIDP manifested by lumbosacral polyradiculopathy primarily involving the lower extremities. I ordered an
MRI of the lumbar spine after the last visit, which showed diffuse enhancement of the cauda equina indicating
somewhat active disease. She has had a change in her exam over the last year and we discussed once again
another trial of an immunosuppressive agent or IV Ig. She has been tried on Imuran, CellCept, Solu-Medrol,
plasma exchanges, and IV Ig without benefit.

Chief Complaint: Follow up for multiple neurologic symptoms and abnormal paraneoplastic panel, with
positive Acetylcholine receptor ganglionic neuronal antibodles
History of Present Illness: She reports that all of her symptoms, including headache, memory
Impairment, galt Imbalance, and orthostasis are stable. I discussed with them that we are stil trying to get
IVIG approved through her insurance.
We reviewed her imaging results.
Mammogram
IMPRESSION-
No radiographic evidence of malignancy.
PET CT skull base to mid thigh
IMPRESSION-
No evidence of FDG-avid malignancy on study limited by large body habitus.
CT chest
FINDINGS- The lungs diffusely emphysematous upper lung predominant,
with centrilobular emphysema and mild paraseptal emphysema near the apex
of a few blebs. There is band-like atelectasis or scarring at the lung
bases bilaterally. There is mild bronchial inflammation within the
dependent portions of the lower lobes bilaterally. A small triangular
shaped juxtapleural nodule within the right middle lobe adjacent to the
minor fissure is seen on image 79 of series 601 and image 79 of series
603, consistent with a small intraparenchymal lymph node along the
fissure. No other imaging for this is required.
No lytic or blastic bone lesions are seen. There is degenerative disc
disease and facet disease within the thoracic spine with mild narrowing
of the central canal on T5-T6 by a posterior facet osteophytes. No rib
leslons are seen. Surgical staples are noted near the left apex
suggestive for a prior left first rib resection presumably for thoracic
Inlet syndrome. The heart size is normal. There is no pleural nor
pericardial effusion. Within the upper abdomen, the adrenals are
normal.
IMPRESSION-
1. Postsurgical change from prior left first rib resection presumably
for thoracic Inlet syndrome.
2. Mild centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema, upper lung predominant,
with mild bronchitis at the posterior lung bases. There is minimal
posterior basilar mucous plugging present.

3. Dependent atelectasis versus mild posterior basllar scar. No lung
nodules or masses are seen.
4. Degenerative disc disease and facet disease in the thoracic spine.
Mild narrowing of the central canal by posterior facet osteophyte at T5-
T6.
CT abdomen/pelvis
IMPRESSION-
1. Degenerative changes in the lumbar spine with moderate to severe
central canal stenosis. Consider MRI for further evaluation, if
radiculopathy is present.
2. No evidence of adenopathy or tumor in the abdomen and pelvis. No
acute findings.
Temporal artery blopsy was negative.
Medications Changed Today:

Physical Exam - Neurology
She answers questions appropriately with fluent speech. PERRL. She endorses diplopia in multiple
directions of gaze. No facial asymmetry or dysarthria. Strength 6/6 in the bilateral upper and lower
extremities. She is hyporeflexic throughout. She has stocking/glove hypesthesla. She has a postural and
kinetic tremor in the bilateral upper extremities. She has orthostatic tremors when arising from the exam
table. She has galt ataxia, and uses Canadian crutches to ambulate.
Assessment
Multiple neurologlo symptoms and signs, including headaches, memory impairment, orthostasis, galt
ataxia, tremor, and evidence of peripheral neuropathy. Her paraneoplastic panel was abnormal, with
positive Acetylcholine receptor ganglionic neuronal antibodies. This is consistent with neurological
autoimmunity, and suspicious for a paraneoplastic syndrome. However, I am not finding any evidence of

primary malignancy. This could either be due to the fact that 1) the autoimmunity is not cancer related or
2) It is cancer related, but the primary is too small to detect at this time, which is often the case. I would
recommend another colonoscopy, but arrangement of this will be deferred to
Will continue
to work on approval of IVIG through Insurance. I let her know that if everything remains negative, I would
recommend another round of cancer screening In 6 months. She will continue Gabapentin for

noted. The remaining paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
There are changes of bilateral cataract surgery. The calvarium is
intact.
The intraorbital contents are symmetric in appearance bilaterally. No
areas of abnormal signal or enhancement are identified. The
intraorbital and intracranial portions of the optic nerves are symmetric
in appearance. The optic chiasm appears within normal limits. No
sellar or suprasellar mass is appreciated. The pituitary infundibulum
is midline. There is no evidence of mass lesion or abnormal enhancement
within the hypothalamus. The extraocular muscles are symmetric in
appearance bilaterally.
Intracranially there is no midline shift, mass effect, hydrocephalus, or
hemorrhage identified. Diffusion weighted images are normal. Midline
structures and posterior fossa are unremarkable. Major intracranial
vascular flow voids are demonstrated. Mild to moderate scattered
subcortical foci of increased T2 / FLAIR signal are similar to
comparison and suggestive of chronic microvascular ischemic changes.

RE:
NEUROLOGICAL EVALUATION
is a 37-year-old, right-handed male with a sensory peripheral neuropathy and superimposed lumbosacral
radiculopathies. He has peripheral neuropathy well documented on electrodiagnostic studies and serologies showed
positive anti sulfatide antibody. Today we discussed at length the risks and benefits profile of IVIgG for his autoimmune
small fiber painful axonal peripheral neuropathy. It is my understanding that his insurance company is denying Mr.
a medication that can significantly improve his quality of life and prevent worsening of his peripheral neuropathy
over time. This is a letter of medical necessity to proceed with IVIgG therapy. Should the insurance company deny Mr.
this therapy; the insurance company will be fully liable for continued pain and suffering on Mr.
part.
This is a circumstance where we have a clearly identifiable cause of a sensory peripheral neuropathy with a clearly
defined treatment option that apparently the insurance company is willing to risk my patient's health and risk significant
liability for worsening symptomatology due to denying a treatment option. We will set appropriate follow-up once the
IVIgG is approved. Should his IVIgG not be approved, we will take appropriate actions.

RE:
NEUROLOGICAL THIRD OPINION
is a 37-year-old, right-handed male who seeks third neurological opinion regarding the diagnosis of
peripheral neuropathy. Mr. states numbness in his legs greater than ten years and more recent numbness in the
feet over five years. This is rather constant. He has burning type sensation with activity. He has numbness in the hands
that waxes and wanes over time. He has undergone electrodiagnostic studies which show absent sural sensory nerve
potentials but also indicators of lumbar radiculopathy. It is reported that blood work has shown a positive anti-sulfatide
antibody just recently. Those results are not available to me at this dictation. Mr. has a long history of low back
pathology and is being followed by pain management with multiple medications.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Anxiety and depression. Hyperprolactinemia, substance abuse.
MEDICATIONS: Soma, methadone, Nexium, Colace, propranolol, Risperdal, Neurontin, Klonopin, Ativan, trazodone,
B12 injections, testosterone.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He states he is disabled. He does not smoke cigarettes nor drink alcoholic beverages.
FAMILY HISTORY: Heart disease, coronary artery disease, breast cancer.
GENERAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure 126/72. Pulse 64 and regular. No carotid bruits or cardiac murmurs. No
rashes or ecchymoses. There are high arches.
NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION: MENTAL STATUS: Alert and oriented. No gross cognitive deficits. CRANIAL
NERVES: Pupils pinpoint reactive. Funduscopic exam shows sharp disc margins. Extraocular motions are intact. There is
normal facial movement. MOTOR EXAMINATION: High arches distally but normal bulk, tone and power. SENSORY
EXAMINATION: Absent vibration sense at the toes. Decreased pinprick in a stocking distribution at the ankle. Decreased
pinprick in the hands up to wrist. No present Tinel's sign. Romberg absent. DEEP TENDON REFLEXES: Diminished in
the lower extremities, 2+ in the upper extremities. GAIT EXAMINATION: Wide based.
IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
is a 37-year-old, right-handed male diagnosed with a
sensory peripheral neuropathy and superimposed lumbosacral radiculopathies. If indeed his anti-sulfatide antibody is
positive he will undergo intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and this is a letter of medical necessity. I would not
recommend new medications at this time. We will set expedited follow-up.

this. He is going to have a PSG next week.
His legs get tender where he had his TKRs. His legs feel restless too, but not so much at night, but when

Comments : Patient has tried to lose weight and I encouraged him to persevere.
Care Plan:
Assessment #5: 357.81 Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuritis
Comments : Spinothalamic sensory, differential dx is broad and includes metabolic factors,
connective tissue diease, etc. In this very overweight patient 
DM is a likely
consideration but A1C and RBS were not raised. He has a prior history of alcoholism
and polysubstance abuse, which may be contributing. The NCS/EMG shows one
derivation potentially consistent with CIDP. Anti GM-1 is negative. The CSF shows a
raised CSF protein and raised RBCs likely due to a traumatic tap, but even with
correction CSF protein is markedly elevated. Therefre a clinical diagnosis of CIDP is
appropriate. I suggested to try IVIG. Treatment alternatives inlcudes prednisone which
given the size of thepatient and the potential for SES would be less desirable
.
Plasmapheresis is another potential treatment option. However this is invasive and
presents logistical problems. The patient agrees. I will start him on 2g/kg 
for 5 
days.
Will hold off on neuropathic pain prophylaxis as pain does not feature at 
this time.

lower extremities. Evaluate for MND.
Dear Dr.
Thank you for your referral. We had the pleasure of seeing Me

reports that approximately 1 year ago in July 2012, she started
noticing, right upper extremity numbness and tingling, with neck
soreness radiating down to her fingertips. She reports her whole right
hand was involved at that time. She also found it difficult to use her
right hand with writing, opening jars, and buttons. She has difficulty
raising her right arm above her shoulders and has significant weakness
in her right upper extremity. She noted progression of these symptoms
to involve her entire right side of the body by
with
progression of the weakness into her right lower extremity, and
currently, involvement of the left upper extremity as well.
""
She has been unable to work out due to these symptoms. She endorses
weakness in her hips and thighs when climbing stairs and holding things
in her right left hand, dropping objects as well. She also endorses
right face, arm, and leg numbness, tingling sensations in her tongue,

any chewing or swallowing problems. No significant dysarthria or
dysphagia. She does note that she has to swallow her saliva frequently
and also noted that her right face seemed droopy and asymmetric compared
to the left.
She had an outside EMG nerve conduction study with findings of
fibrillations and positive sharp waves in the left deltoid, biceps,
triceps in
In addition, she was given a diagnosis of a
brachial plexopathy or neuropathy and had an MRI of the cervical spine
of which she did not have the reports, but was told by a physician that
it was a normal MRI cervical spine study. In addition, she also had
some blood work, which we do not have the records of. She has not had
an MRI of the brain yet. She denies cramping, no stiffness, no
myalgias, no difficulty with relaxation. She reports right facial
numbness with noticeable decreased nasolabial fold and facial asymmetry.
No burning, cramping, pins and needles like sensations in her upper or

PATIENT:
DOB:
MRN No:
The patient is in the office for followup appointment. She has completed the
laboratory studies with the primary care physician which again demonstrated a
positive ANA and double-stranded DNA and also elevated hemoglobin Alc. The
patient continues to complain of severe sensory disturbances in skin, persistent
itching, pain and discomfort that is making her ""miserable."" She says that she cannot
tolerate this. She does not feel good and then she is very distressed with these
problems. The patient was diagnosed with small fiber neuropathy. She went to a
rheumatologist, who did not conclude that the patient has lupus, but her results
definitely suggested possibility of small fiber lupus neuropathy. The patient also
continues to use aspirin 81 mg daily. She has completed neurocognitive evaluation,
which was consistent with attention deficit and concentration problem. The patient
says that she had difficulties in school and that was old problem that she has been
experiencing. She also has repeat MRI of the brain which again showed stable
meningioma and the patient also has a history of adrenal cyst which was diagnosed
with the CAT scan several years ago. The followup ultrasound did not reveal any
results of that, though the patient says that she has very afraid of cancer because of
significant family history including her father who had lymphoma and mother had
kidney cancer. The patient is experiencing significant pain in her right arm and is
again tender and sensitive on the touch and very uncomfortable.
NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is alert and oriented. Her heart has a
regular rhythm. She does have excoriation on the skins, erythema and significant
hyperalgesia. There is tenderness in the muscles of the right shoulder. She has
positive Romberg test, reduced vibration sensation in the ankles. Skin is warm and
dry.

PLAN:
1. For small fiber neuropathy, possibly lupus induced, she will continue gabapentin
300 mg one in the evening and Lyrica 150 mg one in the morning. I believe this
patient would benefit from IVIG 2 gm per kg divided in five days. Percocet 5/325
three times daily as needed. Continue aspirin 81 mg daily.
2. Intuniv (guanfacine) 1 mg extended release daily for two weeks and then continue
with 2 mg daily.
3. MRI of the kidneys.
4. Trigger point injections and then followup in my office in six weeks.

weakness.
Routine followup for bilateral hand and right foot
History:
is a 56-year-old right-handed woman, who returns to
the clinic after last being seen on
She arrives
unaccompanied today. At the conclusion of the last visit, there was a
concern for multifocal motor neuropathy versus motor neuron disease.
She was sent for further evaluation with EMG and nerve conduction
studies and sent for blood work as well.
Today, she returns after having EMG performed at this facility on
Since her last visit, she does report one fall on
while at home stating that she had no warning of the fall. Since
that time, she has received x-rays of the lower back and hip which, she
reports, are unremarkable for fracture or other abnormality, Since the
fall, she has noticed tingling involving the bottom of her left foot,
and she has also noticed more difficulty with her ability to write using
her right hand and increased weakness of her left hand. She does report
having a lumbar epidural injection done on
The following
day, she did notice worsening left hand weakness which, she states, has
not improved. She is scheduled to have another lumbar epidural on
She states that the previous injection did improve
her back pain, although she did notice some weakness of her extremities.
She has also noticed that heat makes her hand and arm weakness somewhat
worse. She has also noticed that her weakness seems to fluctuate at
times not necessarily within a day. She reports going to a casino in
during which, she used her four-wheeled walker less than she
normally did.
The patient otherwise denies problems with dysphasia, dysarthria, voice
changes, difficulty chewing, respiratory problems, or GI problems. She
does report having long-term problems with nocturia, getting up at least
once every hour at night, and does wear a pad.
Review of Systems: 12-point review of systems was performed with
pertinent positives as reported above in subjective; all others were
negative.
Medications!
Currently, no medications.
Allergies:
No known drug allergies.

right median and bilateral ulnar neuropathies. The findings are not
consistent with a disorder of the motor neurons or its axons. A
superimposed motor neuropathy with conduction block cannot be ruled out
with certainty on this study.

back pain without diabetes.
Technique: Nerve conduction study portion was derformed under the usual standard stimulus conditions The active recording.
reference, & ground electrodes were placed in an appropriate manner. The stimulator generated an action potential in the
appropriate nerve w/stimulus duration, intensity, 3. rate necessary to produce a maximal response. The high & low frequency
filter settings were set at the corresponding settings for the motor & sensory nerve conduction study, H. reflex, & F. response.
The sensory & motor amplitudes, latencies,& conduction velocities were recorded. The EMG was performed on the
appropriste limb/limbs using aseptic technique. The sweep velocity, sensitivity, & filter settings were adjusted accordingly for
needle examination of the various muscles were at rest & with minimal & maximal contraction. A mono; olar needle was used
for the needle examination.
Results: The raw data and waveforms are documented on the worksheet all 4 motor F. responses of the ower extremities are
moderately prolonged with a borderline prolongation of both H. reflexes. The left peroneal CMAP amplitude is mildly reduced.
No sensory abnormalities of the IV nerves tested EMG of the lotion remedies were tested. The left and right medial and
lateral gastrocnemij action potentials were of normal morphology with mild decreased recruitment with naximal effort. Similar
findings when testing the left tibial anterior tibialis muscle. No abnormalities seen when testing the left and right vastus
medialis and right and left tibialis muscles. the left and right biceps fernoris long head motor Action po-entials were nomal

Dear
Thank you
for referring this articulate 55-year-old firefighter for
neurological consultation for loss of motor function in both legs.
He is accompanied by his wife
and I have a report of an MRI of
the lumbar spine that was performed on
and it reveals an D4-5
herniated disk with severe bilateral neuroforaminal narroting and 15-S1
moderate neuroforaminal narrowing and to a lesser extent it 13-4 and at
L2-3. He has been having | chronic pain for several years and he has
been receiving lumbar epidural injections every few months under your
guidance with the last one performed two weeks ago as well as being on
short- and long-acting opiate medication for his pain man igement. This
has allowed him to function despite his lower back pain. He rates the
pain at a level of 3-5 with the medication and has noticed it allows
him to work as a firefighter; however, couple of months ago, he noticed
sudden onset of shooting electrical-like pain in his nock travelling
down his hands while he is doing yard work at home. He thought it was
due to the electrical device, but this persisted throughout the day
whenever he would flex his neck. He has not had any rec irrence of his
symptoms nor does he have any asscciated neck pain o: numbness
weakness in his hands, and at the same time he developed weakness in
both his legs, it occurs throughout the day and indepencent rest.

Assessment
Progressive motor weakness. This is bilateral as there is some right finger extensor
weakness. This is not as pronounced as his left upper extremity weakness. For the most
part this is in the radial nerve distribution of the digit suggestive of finger flexor weakness
on the left. Given the absence of significant sensory symptoms, I suspect this is not a
plexopathy or radial neuropathy. I would expect sensory features with those. A multifocal
motor neuropathy is possible. Motor neuron disease, unfortunately, is a consideration as
well.
Plan
1. I am requesting the results of his prior EMG.
2. I am performing a right upper extremity EMG.
3. Await results of MRI scheduled for later this week.
4. Laboratory testing to include GM1 antibodies, CK, copper, TSH, vitamin B12.
Chief Complaint
Weakness in left hand
History of Present Illness
In January of this year he noticed difficulty carrying some skis. Since then, he noticed
progressive difficulty with left hand strength. There is some mild discomfort. There are no
clear sensory symptoms. There is a dull pain in the dorsum of the hand and the ulnar
aspect. If he holds his elbow flexors his wrist aches, and then he gets a cramp in the
posterior forearm on the left. He did not notice any twitches or cramps. He does not notice
any problems in the right upper extremity of either lower extremity.
Cervical spine MRI apparently showed no problems. His brachial plexus MRI is pending and
will be done later this week. A recent EMG reportedly showed a radial neuropathy.

CC: weakness
Handedness: right
HPI:
is a 70 y.o. female with history of stroke, hypertension and polycythemia vera who
presents for follow up of diffuse weakness complicated by bilateral foot drop and diffuse parhesthisa.
Following last visit, I discussed case with patient's orthopedic surgeon, Dr.
and we both
agreed that patient's symptoms are out of proportion to cervical spine findings on MRI. The neuropathy
work up I ordered was remarkable for high ANA and dsDNA (161) values, concerning for SLE. In
addition there was low vitamin B12. I had recommended vitamin B12 supplementation provided by PCP
- however I felt that vitamin B12 deficiency alone would not explain severe level of weakness. I
discussed the case with the patient's rheumatologist in MA, Dr.
who follows patient for
fibromyalgia. Dr.
states that patient only recently developed high ANA titers but borderline
dsDNA. Patient also never had SLE symptoms. Based on recent laboratory findings. Dr.
concerned that she may have SLE. As such I refereed patient to Dr.
rheumatology,
here in Based on his assessment he was more concerned that patient may have Sjogren disease as
patient complained of dry mouth. However, he was also cautious to establish this as a definitive
diagnosis because patient is also taking amitriptyline which can cause dry mouth. If patient does have a
rheumatologic disorder it is likely mild. Therefore, it seemed unlikely that patient's neuropathy is a
complication of a rheumatologic disorder. The leading diagnosis then is likely CIDP. I discussed this with
the patient and her husband via telephone. I discussed Vig therapy and the risks and benefits. She
stated she was willing to undergo a treatment. She is here today to further explore this.
was
Overall weakness and paresthesia have not changed much. At last visit, she was provided AFOs by
NEOPS. This has improved stability during transfers. She is able to plant her feet on the ground and has
an easier time walking with assists. However she still requires assists and cannot ambulate
independently with a walker. Aside from gait instability, she has significant fine motor impairment and
reports difficulty buttoning clothes and picking up small objects such as coins.
Patient takes amitriptyline 25mg QHS as a sleeping aid, prescribed by PCP. She continues to take
gabapentin 900mg TID, also provided by PCP, which has helped manage neuropathy symptoms. She
did not notice a change in neuropathy when amitriptyline was started.

He's noted progressive atrophy of his L calf over the past year, and that makes him want to take
some type of treatment.
Thinks he's been in denial about progression of symptoms.
Wife noted in

Not aware of R foot weakness.
Exam:
Unstressed gait close to normal (perhaps
slight slapping of feet).
Can't walk on his heels.
Can't push body weight up on L ball of foot.
Can do so repeatedly on R.
UE strength not tested in detail, he has clear
severe L radial nerve distribution weakness.
Strength 4/5 ankle dorsiflexors, weaker on the R.

had recommended no treatment, in phone
conversation with him recently he agreed trial of
azathioprine was reasonable, patient is most inclined
to go with IVlg.
Plan:
Discussed issues,
He very much wants to try some treatment, despite
the uncertainties of the situation.
He was disappointed that there was R ankle dorsiflexion
weakness (hadn't registered that at previous visit).
Will check if he's candidate for azathioprine (TPMT level),

MADSAM with slow progression of deficits over time.
Failure to effect improvement with one trial of IVlg.
Slow progression over years -- never remission
likely to continue progression unless some therapy
instituted.
For MMN, IVlg superior to prednisone. MADSAM more
of a condition intermediate to MMN and CIDP, with some
prospect of responding to prednisone -- but with response
defined as, most likely, slowed or no progression, would
need a relatively long trial with significant risk. IVlg also
with some risk of stroke in older patients.
On balance, a trial of azathioprine might be most appropriate -
despite uncertain benefit, unlikely to produce harm. Alternative
would be cyclophosphamide, more likely to produce benefit,
but more likely to harm as well.
Plan:
Long discussion of these therapeutic issues with patient.
At this point, given his observation of progression over time,
he would like to start with some treatment.
I told him I wanted to give some further thought to what I
would recommend, but I think azathioprine might be best
(because safest)

Interpretation:
Nerve conduction studies of the left lower extremity reveal normal findings on the peroneal and tibial motor studies. The
peroneal F-wave study is normal; the tibial F-wave study is notable for the presence of axon reflexes, and the tibial F
responses are mildly prolonged. Sensory studies reveal low-amplitude responses, probably within normal limits for age.
Needle EMG reveals signs of active and chronic denervation in the left tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius; no EMG
abnormalities are noted in proximal muscles, spanning spinal segments L2-S2. These findings are consistent with an
axon-loss lesion of the left sciatic nerve; a multifocal disorder, e.g., lesions of both the tibial and peroncal nerves, could
also produce these electrophysiological findings. Clinical correlation is advised.

History of Present Illness
The patient is a 66 year old male
Note:
Is a 66 year old right handed gentleman who is here in neurologic consultation for evaluation of
bilateral hand tremors and new onset weakness. His son tells us that his troubles started in the first week of March
when his insulin was changed to Vistoza and after the first dose, he broke out in an allergic rash. He went to
Windham hospital and was admitted to the ICU x 3 days then discharged home shortly after. He did not require
intubation but his son says that they needed to bring him back to the ED every day x few days after discharge
because he has just been in constant excruciating pain. His son does not know if he had required treatment with
steroids or a muscle relaxant while he was in the ICU. He describes that he has sharp burning pain in the medial
aspect of both arms all the time and he is getting progressively weaker. They had noted left sided weakness while
he was in the hospital but this has since progressed to both arms and legs. He has been wheelchair bound since
discharge but he feels that he continues to get worse. His son notes that he is losing muscle bulk, has arm
cramping and occasional fasciculations. They have him wearing gloves now just to keep his hands open. He is
unable to write and has difficulty holding anything. He is totally dependent for all ADLs at this point. He can weight
bear to some degree for transfers but his son practically holds him up. He has episodic tremors of either arm and
ballistic flailing on occasion without associated alteration in mental status. This can occur even as he lies in bed.
He is developing pressure sores in his posterior calf.
He admits to some dysphagia and lightheadedness, but denies urinary incontinence. In the hospital, his son recalls
that they had trouble with labile blood pressure readings. He admits to some breathing difficulties and says he is
easily fatigued. He has occasional difficulties with memory and slurring of speech. He denies blurring of vision or
diplopia. He also says that even now, he is constant pain and discomfort described as diffuse, excruciating sharp
pain for which he sometimes requires morphine.
His cranial MRI
showed minimal small vessel ischemic changes but no evidence of an acute stroke. There
was incidental note of sinus and mastoid air cell disease L > R. He recently had a 3 day video EEG which was also
reportedly normal. In retrospect, upon specific questioning, he admits to having had flu like symptoms a few days
prior to his hospitalization. He denies having had diarrhea.

CC / HPI:
This is a 74-year-old lady who was in her usual state of health until
when she started having
night sweats that lasted about 4 days. She was treated with Cipro and then Levaquin. She had fevers of 104.
She was evaluated at
where they treated her with steroids which seemed to help. Then at
the end of October and beginning of November she woke up one day with numbness, burning and tingling in
her hands and feet. Since then she has also noticed weakness in the distal extremities of all four limbs. She has
had some trouble walking. During that admission she was evaluated by neurologist, rheumatologist and had
extensive testing. MRI of her brain in
was unremarkable. MRI of the cervical spine in
was also unremarkable. She does not have any constipation. She does not get orthostatic
lightheadedness. They put her on Lyrica and she is taking 150 mg twice a day which seems to help with the
pain. Her limbs always feel cold. She has to wear socks and mittens.
EMG/nerve conduction studies were done of the legs on and then of the arms on
Both studies
showed evidence of a severe neuropathic process with evidence of axonal and demyelinating features. This
pattern was most suggestive of an axonal form of CIDP. Lab work for B12, serum protein electrophoresis,
folate, creatine kinase, aldolase, TSH were unremarkable on The Lyrica at 150 mg twice a day has not
helped with the pain at all. I started her on Cymbalta just a few days ago and it has not helped with the pain
either. She has only taken 30 mg a day. She has a constant severe pain between her right big toe. She has
difficulty walking and going up stairs. She feels off-balance.
She presented with weakness.
In addition, she presented with Foot Drop.
The patient also presented with paresthesia.

DATE OF CONSULTATION:
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Weakness.
PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR:
MD.
REASON FOR FOLLOWUP:
Weakness and motor neuron disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr.
is a 56-year-old ambidextrous
Caucasian male who returns to
accompanied by
his wife after being seen in
At the conclusion of the last
visit, it was thought that he most likely has lower motor neuron
predominant ALS. The patient since 2011 has developed painless
progressive weakness of his right arm and extremities despite the
cervical spine surgery for multilevel degenerative disk in
He continued to have progression of his right arm weakness. On exam, he
continues to have progression of lower motor neuron features with the
right greater than left. His EMG has been positive for diffuse active
and chronic denervation consistent with motor neuron disease. He has
also had SPEP with immunofixation showed on IgA kappa with repeat SPEP
being stable. Results for a GM1 antibody pending.
INTERVAL HISTORY: The patient continues to have no features such as
rigidity or feelings of stiffness or spasticity. He continues to have
atrophy and weakness of his lower and upper extremities. He denies any
bulbar symptoms such as difficulty with speech and swallow. He has lost
a coup of pounds, but overall his weight is same as before. There is
no pseudobulbar affect such as excessive crying, sadness, or
inappropriate happiness. There is no sign of excessive salivation. His
only main problem is that he is noticing more difficulty with rolling
out of bed. He needs assistance of his wife to stand, but once in a
standing position with some assistance can take steps forward. He
continues to have feelings of twitching all over his body in the upper
and lower extremities, Denies any problem or change in his speech or
tone of voice.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A 14-point review of system was performed and
negative except what is mentioned in the HPI.

Visit:
Age: 58y
Gender: Male
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, history of left
wrist fracture, left carpal tunnel, and left Bell palsy with residual
ptosis, and history of borderline glucose intolerance.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Riluzole 50 mg one tablet twice a day,
multivitamins, vitamin D 5000 International Units,
hydrochlorothiazide/lisinopril 12.5/20, Coenzyme Q10, and aspirin 61 mg
daily.
ALLERGIES:
NKDA,
Reviewed with no significant change
SOCIAL FAMILY AND SURGICAL HISTORY:
compared with prior exam.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Vital Signs: Blood pressure 141/89, temperature 96.9, pulse 77, and
respiration 18. Weight 221, unable to be compared to the prior weight
as the patient is in wheelchair.
HEENT: Atraumatic and normocephalic.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation,
Heart: Normal S1 and $2.
Extremities: No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Neurologic Examination: Mental Status: Alert and oriented x3. Good
comprehension and language is intact. Speech is spontaneous, fluent,
without any aphasia or dysarthria. Cranial Nerves: Extraocular motors
are intact. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive. Face symmetrical.
Facial sensation intact to light touch and crude touch. Tongue is
midline. Uvula is midline. There is no signs of tongue atrophy or
fasciculations. The patient is able to bury his eyelashes
appropriately. Smile is midline. Lateral tongue movement is good
frequency. Neck flexor and extensors are 5/5 bilaterally.
Motor Exam: Diffuse atrophy and fasciculation noted throughout reduced
tone frankly in the upper extremities. No spasticity noted. MRC scale
of upper extremities and lower extremities right, left: Deltoid 1, 2;
biceps 1, 3; triceps 4-, 3; wrist extensors 1, 1, wrist flexors 4, 4;
finger flexors 4, 4; FDI 4-, 4-; APB 4-, 4-; hip flexors 4-, 4+, hip
extensors 4-, 4; knee flexors 4+, 4+; knee extensors 4+, 4+;
dorsiflexion 4, 4; plantar flexion 5, 5; and extensor hallucis 4, 4.
Reflexes are 1+ in the upper extremities, 2+ in the lower extremities.
JAMAR grip was noted to be 5 on the right and 30 on the left.
Sensory
is intact to light touch, vibration, and crude touch symmetrical
bilaterally. Gait: The patient is able to stand with assistance and
walk with mild assistant.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Mr.
is a 58-year-old gentleman who started
to develop painless progressive weakness in his upper extremities, then
progressing to his lower extremities. Since the past year, the
pati
t's sym predominantly remained lower motor neuron in nature
associated with atrophy, fasciculations, and without any signs of upper
motor neuron without any brisk reflexes or increased tone. He has
continued to progresswith associated weakness and on exam today. He
continues to have predominantly lower motor neuron without any bulbar or
respiratory findings. Given his recent examination, the patient most
likely has multifocal motor neuropathy and less likely to have lower
motor neuron predominant ALS.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. We would like to start him on a course of IVIG therapy, we will
submit necessary paperwork to insurance for approval.

2. We may also consider a muscle biopsy to evaluate for group atrophy.
3. We would like him to continue riluzole in the interim 50 mg b.i.d.
4. Respiratory evaluate him and found his FVC predicted to be 118 which
is slightly lower than 127 from prior visit and SNIP was 92% versus
last visit was 86 and MIP was 199 compared with prior visit which was
95. Overall, there is no deterioration in his respiratory status.
No further intervention needed at this time.
5. Weakness and motor deficits.
a. He was evaluated by physical therapy; due to the progression of
weakness in his arms and hands, Mr. Engle is
not able to propel
a standard manual wheelchair. He is non-ambulatory. Therefore recommend
a transport
wheelchair for safe mobility
b. He had an ALS functional rating scale performed which he scored
33, prior which is slightly lower by 4
points.
c. Social worker evaluated and spoke with the family regarding the
health and assistance as well as counseling.
d. Return to clinic in three months.
Thank you for the consult.
Neurology Attending I personally met with this patient. I reviewed key
portions of the history and personally repeated key portions of the
neurological examination. Please refer to the detailed note by Dr.
for details on the history, review of systems and examination. I
have discussed the case in detail with Dr.
and agree with the
assessment and management plan as outlined above. Mr.
is a
58-year-old male who in 2011 developed painless weakness of his right
upper extremity; despite cervical spine surgery (for multilevel
degenerative disc disease) in
he continued to have progression
of his right arm weakness and by
started to diffusely affect his
left arm. On exam, he continues to have progression of prominent lower
motor neuron features with multimyotomal diffuse atrophy and weakness of
both arms, rig left, and dorsiflexion and hip flexion weakness
bilaterally, fasciculations in his arms and thighs, with diminished
reflexes in both arms. Brain and C spine MRI are unrevealing for a
structural lesion that can explain his weakness. His EMG showed diffuse
active and chronic denervation consistent with motor neuron disease.
SPEP with IF showed mild IgA Kappa very low concentration (0.51, 0.12)
of unclear clinical significance and stable (last checked 1); GM1 Ab
pending.
Given his prominent lower motor neuron features, without any signs of
upper motor neuron findings as well as lack of bulbar or respiratory
involvement, we discussed the possibility of multifocal motor neuropathy
and at this point a 3 month trial of IVIg is warranted. We could
additionally perform a muscle biopsy to see if he has signs of large
group atrophy. In the interim, he plans to continue Riluzole and needs a
wheel chair (medically necessary) for mobility. We discussed the risks.
and benefits of IVIg, he agrees, and wishes to pursue treatment. We had
him meet with members of our multidisciplinary team and would like to
see him back in 3 months to see how he is coming along. Thank you for
allowing us to participate in his care. Sincerely,
Neuromuscular Attending,

PATIENT:

MRN No:
The patient is in the office for followup appointment. The patient says that she did not
take Effexor. She really could not tolerate this medication. She said that she is treated
with the prednisone by her rheumatologist and by Oxycodone by her pain specialist
and she could not tolerate neither of these medicines. She is complaining of constant
pain in her extremities, numbness and severe discomfort, pain in her whole body. The
patient had EMG study, which was consistent with the sensory motor polyneuropathy
of mixed type, demyelinating with the axonal component. In laboratory studies she
was found to have pre-diabetes with the elevated hemoglobin A1C. This result is
consistent with diabetic CIDP variant of neuropathy and I explained to the patient that
treatment with the immunoglobulin may be potentially helpful. She tried so many
different medicines in the past and physical therapies, but none of them was working.
She continues to be in a chronic pain and depression because of the symptoms. I also
described to the patient about the treatment with electrical stimulation and she already
found some information about that on internet. I recommended the patient to do
physical therapy that would include rebuilder device that stimulates the nerves in
periphery and was found to be helpful with patient who have painful peripheral
neuropathy.
NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is alert and oriented. Here she
appears somewhat depressed. She has no signs of ataxia. No pronator drifts. She has
weakness in the bilateral triceps muscles, which is 5-, with the elements of give away
weakness and pain. She has quadriceps and hamstrings 5, gastric 5, tibials anterior
bilaterally 5. She does have reduced pinprick sensation and vibration sensation in the
extremities. Deep tendon reflexes, brachioradialis is 3+ with negative Hoffman, ankle
reflexes is 1+, and plantar reflex is 3+.

PLAN:
1. I believe the patient has exhausted practically all options and I think that this
patient may benefit from IVIg treatment 2 g/kg divided in five days 
monthly. Her
variant of neuropathy is mixed type but only demyelinating and it is 
most likely dis-
regulated with glucose in origin due to elevated hemoglobin A1C.
2. I recommended physical therapy with the electrical stimulation called rebuilder.
3. I still encourage the patient to restart Effexor 37.5 mg daily. I 
think there is 
also
depressive component.
4. I will see her again in my office in six weeks.

History of Present Illness
The patient is a 69 year old female who presents for a recheck of Neuropathy. Patient presents with her husband. She has
had continued worsening of her numbness in her feet, up to her knees. She has been having some burning to her feet as well
which has been relieved somewhat by using tea tree oil. She is very unsteady and uses a cane for stability. She is no longer ableto 
walk longer than 5 minutes at a time, has much less endurance. She has been using a new orthotic in her shoes which is
helping somewhat with her steadiness. She is unable to stand up from a chair without assistance or pushing herself up from thechair arms. She has 
noticed continued weakness in her hands as well. Unable to open doorknobs or jars. Drops items easily and
has poor coordination. She does not ""feel right,"" especially when trying to hold a conversation. She has to search for her words.
Continues to be independent in ADL's. Mind feels ""clouded"" at all times. She has had foot surgeries (bone spur removal fromleft 
foot; heel fusion on right) which exacerbated the neuropathy at the time, but she hasn't had more surgery to her feet since
2011 yet the neuropathic symptoms and muscle weakness continues to worsen. She is wondering if this could still be an affect
from 
the 
contaminated sutures that were used on her during a transthoracic nissen repair surgery in 1994.

Assessments & Plans
● DMYLNATING POLYNEURITIS, CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY (357.81) (Established Diagnosis) Ongoing
immune response possibly triggered by contaminated sutures in 1994, resulting in probable CIDP
- Lumbar puncture to evaluate for presence of any protein
- Recommend IVIG treatment once LP is completed
- Discussed that IVIG would be to help with strength and possibly pain. Will need physical therapy along with IVIG
treatments.
• Evaluated for: LUMBAR RADICULOPATHY (724.4); LUMBAR CANAL STENOSIS (724.02); LESION,
LATERAL POPLITEAL NERVE (355.3); DM W/NEURO MANIFESTATIONS, TYPE II (250.60) (Rule Out)

Additional Instructions
NCS/EMG STUDIES PERFORMED:
Summary # of studies performed during this session as documented above:
(ABC = Antebrachial Cutaneous)
Lower extremity ICD-9 codes = 724.4; 250.60; 358.00; 357.89
Medicare 13+ Studies (CPT code = 95913) =1
Repetitive Stimulation (CPT code = 95937) = = 4
Final Interpretation and Diagnosis:
1) There is evidence for a mixed sensory-motor, demyelinating, axonal polyneuropathy in the lower extremities.
Given the high risk for spread of the polyneuropathy to the hands/arms causing additional morbidity and the
additional increased risk for carpal tunnel syndrome and other mononeuropathies in the arms, this patient will be
brought back to the office for a bilateral upper extremity EMG study (unless already recently performed in our
office).

History of Present Illness
68-year-old male referred to neurology for complaints of diffuse weakness and muscle atrophy. He reports that this
has been present for about the past 6 months and has been progressive without any apparent provocation at that
time. He has noticed significant impairment in ambulation and muscle wasting in the distal upper and lower
extremities over this timeframe. He has not yet seen a neurologist for further evaluation. He has not yet had an
EMG or nerve conduction study. He states that he has significant difficulty getting up out of a chair and has to
ambulate with a cane. He denies any history of fasciculations and has no other associated neurologic complaints.

History of Present Illness
is a 40 year old caucasian female from
who presents for
evaluation of MS. History is provided by the patient. Patient is accompanied by spouse.
The patient returns in follow-up. In the interval the flu-like symptoms she was having have gone away.
She still feels very tired and fatigued. She sleeps all the time she says. I questioned whether or not it
might be related to the gabapentin she is on (300 mg three times a day). Certainly people with multiple
sclerosis are also very fatigued all the time. Another possibility is regarding her sleep. We would have to
pursue that further if nothing else seems to be amenable to treatment.
Today we have gone back through and discussed the nerve conduction tests. She has evidence of
demyelinating neuropathy, possibly suggestive of CIDP. I went back through the history again and she
indicates clearly that she did begin last summer with numbness in her feet. It ascended but didn't stop at
the knees and went all the way up to the waist. It was at that point that we found the thoracic spinal lesion
and the six spots in the brain. Her CSF was abnormal with a pleocytosis and slight elevation in protein. I
do not have a note on the oligoclonal bands.
Today the patient by examination does have knee jerks. She does not have ankle jerks.

if he has any other advice in terms of work-up for this. Also we will pursue the oligoclonal bands. I've told
her to stop the gabapentin for the next few days until I get back to her next week with the results of this
conference and we will see if that helps with the fatigue.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
is a 57-year-old right-handed woman with the past medical history for chronic progressive
polyneuropathy, whom I saw in consultation recently.
Her symptoms started in 1986, while she was pregnant with her first child. Initially, she developed bilateral
hand weakness and intermittent numbness and tingling, associated with a mild tremor. In the following few
months after childbirth, she began experiencing bilateral foot numbness and tingling. After the initial fairly
prominent sensory symptoms, there was an improvement, and her presentation has been dominated by
weakness and tremor. She has bilateral hand weakness, wasting of the hand muscles, as well as difficulty
walking with a partial foot drop. She still walks without any assistive device and she is able to wear regular
shoes, but she describes a typical flopping of the feet, especially on the right. There is some impairment of
balance or yet she continues to exercise, she walks several miles a few times a week and she rides a bicycle.
Her symptoms have been only mildly progressive, but since
and is being in the appearance
of numbness and tingling in her feet, especially on the right lateral calf, as well as as new pain in her hands,
affecting the dorsal aspects, especially on the radial side.

testing and serologic tests, with no identifiable cause.
I suspected CIDP and I was particularly worried about antiMAG polyneuropathy, given her tremor. I
repeated the electrodiagnostic studies, which showed edema in including neuropathy with conduction block.
Serologic tests did not show a paraprotein or antiMAG antibodies.
Earlier this week, I performed an LP. The CSF showed elevated protein at 73 and white blood cells 10.
Cytology was negative.
She called yesterday reporting a persistent orthostatic headache, which typically starts after 10 min. of
standing. An epidural patch was scheduled for later today

RE:
I saw
in the office for a follow up. He is a 61 year old male with left arm numbness
and weakness. Patient was last seen on
with the following:
IMPRESSION:
1. Left arm numbness./weakness
2. Cervical myelopathy
3. Doubt ALS
Comment:
The exam shows a progressive mild lower motor neuron disturbance, with UMN signs in the legs.
This is most likely to be 2 different processes, and not motor neuron disease. Consider Mulitfocal
Motor Neuropathy with previous cervical myelopathy, Doubt MADSAM, B12 deficiency,
paraproteinemia.
I recommend the following:
1) IVIG 0.4 grams/kg daily for 5 days, then 2gm/kg monthly for 6 months,
2) IFE to r/o IgA deficiency
3) Second opinion with

and not sure what was causing it. Patient did feel it was helping and he feels the left hand is
stiffening,cramping and the dexterity is not there and it feels tight.
Doesn't want to return to had a bad experience overall. Only new finding is small fiber
neuropathy in the distal leg (0.9 fibers/mm).
After 5 days of IVIG, had return of normal sensation in the left arm 10 days later, 50% better, fingers
felt less numb. 2 weeks later, progressed back to the original deficit over another 2 weeks. Felt
better for about a month.

RE:
I saw
in followup today. He is a 60 y.o, male who on last visit had the
following problems:
1) left arm numbness and weakness
2) UMN/LMN syndrome
3) left rotator cuff syndrome
Discussion:
His examination shows LMN weakness of the left arm and UMN involvement of both legs. The
sensory involvement suggests a lesion distal to the dorsal root ganglion, as well as spinal cord
involvement. The DDx includes motor neuron disease, multifocal conduction block neuropathy,
neuralgic amyotrophy, cervical cord injury.
More than half of 60 minutes was spent discussing the pathophysiology and treatment of the above
medical issues and all questions were answered.
I made the following recommendations:
1) EMG/NCS
2) left shoulder exercises
3) level I neuropathy eval, GMI, MAG antibodies
Since last visit
is a 60 year old male with neck pain and numbness in the left arm
and hand. The neck pain is no change, but pain in arm is increasing and numbness has traveled
up to the bicep area. He is here today to discuss the results of testing and treatments. He has not
tried any shoulder exercises that were given, but has been very active lately working the arm.
The lab tests show normal GM1, 2 hour GTT 151. inistructed to lose 10% BW and exercise daily.
The EMG demonstrated left arm fasciculations, some denervation in 2 of 3 limbs, prolonged F
responses and reduced sensory responses.
He has had cervical spinal fusion x 2, MRI demonstrated narrowing of the cord. He had had prior
MRIs demonstrating severe canal stenosis. Prior to surgery, he had a normal EMG.

History of present illness
The patient is a 55-year-old female presenting for followup of CIDP and migraines. She received 2 days of IV Solu-Medrol earlier this
month which were complicated by hyperglycemia and headaches. She followed a sliding scale for insulin but had blood sugar readings of
greater than 400. The patient reports a resolution of hyperglycemia at present but reports persistent difficulties with headaches on a daily
basis. She achieves good abortive relief from Cambia, but notes that she is only allotted 9 packets every 3 months through her insurance.
Current headache pain is less severe than previous migraines. She denies any identifiable change in leg pain, weakness, or strength over
the past several weeks. She now ambulates with the assistance of a rolling walker and is no longer participating in physical therapy. The
patient describes diffuse numbness extending from the left ankle to the left hip. She additionally has pain throughout the right leg that is
sensitive to even light touch. She denies any falls at home, but has frequent difficulty rising from a seated position.
Current medication
Lyrica 100 mg daily, Topamax 100 mg q.a.m. and 200 mg nightly, bupropion SR 150 mg daily, Lexapro 20 mg daily, Seroquel 300 mg
daily, Nexium 40 mg daily, metformin 1000 mg b.i.d., levothyroxine 100 mcg daily, glimepiride 4 mg daily, Klonopin 0.5 mg b.i.d. and 1-2
mg nightly, Palgic 4 mg daily, Aleve p.r.n., Vicodin p.r.n., Cambia 50 mg p.r.n. migraine, meclizine 25 mg daily p.r.n. dizziness.

mg to use in place of Cambia for abortive relief of breakthrough migraines. She was instructed on the need to refrain from other NSAIDs
on the day of dosing. I will follow up with her in one month to monitor her response to IVIG, and encouraged the patient to contact our
office with any questions or concerns in the interim. She may benefit from a referral to physical therapy once pain and weakness are
better controlled.

The patient received her first infusion of Solu-Medrol yesterday and reports a significantly elevated blood sugar. She ate fast food on her
ride home and had a reading of 491 after arriving home. The patient administered insulin according to her sliding scale, but proceeded to
the ER when her level remained above 400. She received another 15 units of insulin while in the ER and was discharged with a level of
331. The patient feels well today and had a fasting reading of 204 this morning. She questions whether she should have her second
dose of Solu-Medrol today.
Plan
I will hold the patient's Solu-Medrol today and ordered a blood sugar reading at the end of her infusion tomorrow. The patient was
encouraged to maintain good hydration and administer insulin as needed following the second infusion. Further treatment will depend on
her response.
Medications
No medications have been prescribed.

History of Present Illness:
8
The patient is a 55-year-old female presenting followup of neuropathy, migraines, and dizziness. She had a
lumbar puncture performed on
Ithat demonstrated elevations in CSF protein, glucose, and
lactic acid, while WBCs were WNL. The patient was originally scheduled to followup with me following a
vacation in early December, but this was delayed due to scheduling difficulties. She describes persistent
difficulties with pain, weakness, and instability despite ongoing treatment with Lyrica 100 mg daily and
outpatient physical therapy. A rolling walker was recommended by her therapist, as the patient achieves
insufficient support from a single-point cane. She continues to report a good response to Cambia 50 mg on a
p.r.n. basis for abortive relief of breakthrough headaches, while dizziness is improved on meclizine 25 mg
daily. The patient denies any notable improvement in RLS despite increasing Klonopin during the day.
Current Medications:
Lyrica 100 mg daily, Topamax 100 mg q.a.m. and 200 mg nightly, bupropion SR 150 mg daily, Lexapro 20
mg daily, Seroquel 300 mg daily, Nexium 40 mg daily, metformin 1000 mg b.i.d., levothyroxine 100 mcg
daily, glimepiride 4 mg daily, Klonopin 0.5 mg b.i.d. and 1-2 mg nightly, Palgic 4 mg daily, Aleve p.r.n.,
Vicodin p.r.n., Cambia 50 mg p.r.n. migraine, meclizine 25 mg daily p.r.n. dizziness.
Impression & Plan:
The patient's nerve conduction studies demonstrated a moderate to marked mixed axonal and demyelinating
polyneuropathy while her CSF is consistent with CIDP. I recommended a 3 day course of IV Solu-Medrol
for improved treatment and will continue Lyrica unchanged at 100 mg daily. A sliding scale of insulin will
be discussed with her PCP and a prescription for a rolling walker was faxed to a local medical supply store.
She will follow up with me in one month to assess her response to this treatment and was encouraged to
contact our office with any questions or concerns in the interim.

DOB:
MRN No:
The patient is in the office after a prolonged period of time. The patient said that she has
developed a swelling in the left elbow, in the cubital fossa where she has pain and
tenderness and palpable mass. She tells me that in the past she had a blood clot in the
leg, which was superficial. She has been still taking aspirin 81 mg daily. The patient
continues to experience symptoms of autonomic neuropathy. She has profuse sweating
episodes and sometimes sensation of cold and discomfort in the extremities. Sometimes
the hands are cold, sometimes the fect. She also tells me that she wakes up sometimes
with her hands that are numb.
The patient was receiving injection of vitamin B12, which is elevated vitamin B12.
However, she is now again complaining of episodes of fatigue that comes in waves. The
patient has a history of autonomic neuropathy and she also receives Plaquenil for lupus.
The patient potentially may benefit from the IVIG treatment but she was unable to
receive that treatment so far. She does not feel that gabapentin really helps. Her
cardiologist changed the amlodipine but that did not affect her sensation in the
extremities although however, she is complaining of significant edema in the ankles. In
the past, she has been taking HCTZ but that did not also made any difference.
NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:
The patient is alert and oriented. Pupils are rounded and symmetric, equally responsive
to light. Face is symmetric. Tongue protrudes midline, there is normal gag reflex. There
is a mass palpable in the left elbow, on the cubital fossa, which is soft but painful, it is
movable. It is about 3 inches in diameter. There is no erythema or signs of infection on
that. In the right arm, she does not have that. She does have slightly reduced vibration
sensation in the ankles and swelling of the ankles. Her heart has a distant sound and
regular rhythm.

PLAN:
1. For the left new developed mass in the left elbow, we will refer this patient for the
MRI of the left elbow and also Doppler of the veins of the upper extremities to
rule out possible DVT. She was advised to start taking aspirin 325 mg daily.
2. For small fiber neuropathy, we will request IVIG treatment with 2g/kg divided in
five days.
3. The patient will continue Plaquenil prescribed by rheumatologist.
4. We will discontinue gabapentin for profuse sweating. We will start amitriptyline
25 mg in the evening.
5. I gave samples of Nuvigil 50 mg p.r.n. fatigue.
6. We will repeat laboratory studies and check vitamin B12, homocysteine, folic
acid, sed rate, thyroid function and CBC.
7. The patient will follow up in my office in six weeks. Potentially, she also may
need medicine Topamax since she continues to experience the headaches, they are
sometimes intense and frequent although Fioricet occasionally helps.

""PATIENTA
DOB:
MRN No:
The patient is in the office for a followup appointment. The patient completed ganglionic
acetylcholinc receptor antibody and they came back negative. The patient has a small fiber
neuropathy along with involvement of autonomic peripheral nerves. She is experiencing persistent
pain in the limbs and extremities, discoloration of the hands and despite taking Plaquenil and
Neurontin, she is in a persistent discomfort. The patient also suffers from headaches, vestibular
dysfunction, and earache. She went to the ENT specialist for consultation who told that she has
eustachian tube dysfunction but the patient did not want to have a procedure, which was in co-
perforation. The patient said that in the past, she was prescribed more gabapentin, which is
apparently helpful but then she starts gaining weight and she scaled back to 100 mg three times
daily. She also received vitamin B12 replacement and a complete extensive laboratory studies and
multiple rheumatological consultations in the past.
NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:
The patient is alert and oriented. Pupils rounded and symmetric, equally responsive to light. There
is tenderness in paraspinal musculature, shoulder, wrists, fingers, and interphalangeal joints. There
is erythematous discoloration of the hands, which is today is a bit better. There is swelling of the
wrists and the ankles. There is a mild scar tissue in the right base of the thumb from surgery. She
does have a slightly reduced vibration sensation in the ankles.
PLAN:
1. For small fiber neuropathy related to antinuclear antibody factor, I recommended IVIG
treatment 2 g/kg divided five days.
2. Continue Plaquenil prescribed by the rheumatologist. We will increase gabapentin to 200
mg three times daily.
3. Another option is also to see with the cardiologist changing medicine to verapamil to
improve microvascular spasm.
4. Followup in my office in four weeks.

CC: Weakness in the legs and numbness in the feet and hands.
History of Present Illness:
-year-old male seen in the neuromuscular department for consultation today regarding progressive
weakness in the legs with mild numbness in the hands and feet. Patient is kindly sent by
DC.
The patient's primary care provider is
M.D.
The patient reports in
he noticed a sensation under of the toes of the right foot
specifically between the third and fourth toe across the ball of the foot that he describes as ""a wide up
sock"". Sensation was bothersome, and he tried numerous interventions such as changing his socks and
shoes new shoes etc. nothing seemed to mitigate the symptoms. In the next 3-4 weeks he began noticing
that his legs felt tired, fatigued and had difficulty going up and down the hills where he feeds his counts.
Your November or
he noticed a progressive worsening of the weakness in his legs area
he began having more trouble going up steps and walking in the fields of his farm. In December he
noticed tingling in the fingertips and the lack of sensation in the feet. He doesn't really have any tingling in
the feet but they are ""numb"". In mid January the left foot began feeling but wanted up sock sensation
under his toes. He has started tripping and fallen 3 or 4 times.
The patient is not using any assistive devices. He tells me that his hands now feel like ""paddles"" he has
trouble buttoning buttons zipping his pants and so forth. 3 weeks ago he had to stop doing many of his
chores because it takes him too long and he just feels ""too weak"". He notices stiffness in the hands and
the feet. He notices he can't cock his ankles up or walk on his heels.
Patient has seen numerous providers and those records have been reviewed. He states he underwent
some type of nephropathic treatment for Lyme disease however blood tests were never taken according to
the patient. Electrodiagnostic studies performed by Dr.
at outside lab demonstrated primary
demyelination with partial motor conduction block, study was reviewed by Dr.
MD.
Patient also underwent steroid injections by podiatry for possible neuroma, he experienced no
improvement in the sensation with his treatment. He denies any pain in the feet or the hands, no burning
quality or abnormal cold sensation.
He denies any antecedent illness to the onset of his symptoms
Past medical history essentially healthy male with some hypertension and diet and exercise treated
hyperlipidemia.
No peripheral neuropathy and the patient's family that he is aware of.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
is year-old patient with neuropathy, is here for followup and
discussion of results of nerve conduction studies. He has diabetic neuropathy for past 10 years, despite
several medication for diabetes including insulin, his blood sugar still fluctuates. His recent nerve
conduction studies, showed evidence of axonal and as well as demyelinating sensory polyneuropathy. He
is taking Neurontin 900 mg a day for diabetic pain syndrome.
PHYSICAL EXAM: Blood pressure was 124/76, heart rate 100 and weight 218 pounds
NEUROLOGICAL EXAM: Mental status was normal; cranial nerves were intact. He has 4/5 strength in
upper and lower extremities proximally and distally. He is very mild atrophy of hand muscles. Reflexes
are absent and he is sensory loss to vibration sense distal extremities. His balance is intact.
IMPRESSION AND PLAN: Diabetic neuropathy associated with demyelinating neuropathy such as CIDP.
The plan is to increase his Neurontin to 1200 mg a day and consider using IVIG. But because of his
diabetes he is somewhat at risk for kidney problems and thrombosis. We carefull using IVIG such as
doing lower dose and go slower. He would be a scheduled for IVIG. I'll evaluate him again in 2 months.

Chief Complaint/Reason for Visit
This 73 year old male presents for follow up of neuropathy.
History of Present Illness
1. Follow Up of neuropathy
Mr
is a 73-year-old man with a history of multiple myeloma and peripheral neuropathy. He is seen today
for follow-up care. Mr was diagnosed to have multiple myeloma in February 2016 and he recalls having
undergone 3 cycles of chemotherapy with Velcade, Revlimid, and Zometa when he first noticed numbness and burning
sensation that started first in his feet and then extended up to his mid thigh over a 4 week period. During this time he also
started experiencing some numbness in the fingertips involving mainly the fourth and fifth digits both his hands and
extending along the medial side of his forearm bilaterally.. He recalls that the dose of Velcade was reduced by 25% for the
fourth cycle and as he has been experiencing severe pain in both his feet and his hands interfering with all routine activities
and sleep. His chemotherapy with Velcade and Zometa has been on hold since Revlimid was stopped just 2
weeks ago. He is also currently off dexamethasone, acyclovir and pantoprazole. During the last visit for control of pain
related to neuropathy his gabapentin was increased to 600 mg 3 times a da y( max renal dose). As he continued to
experience pain, Cymbalta was added about 5 days ago. He is currently on 30 mg once a day with slight relief of pain. He
has also been prescribed capsaicin gel which he applies to both his feet. Plan is to hold chemotherapy due to the severe
pain. He continues to experience weakness in both his feet and he has trouble picking up his foot. He was prescribed an
ankle foot orthosis to help with the gait stability. He also has mild weakness in his hands. An EMG and nerve conduction
study done weeks ago was suggestive of a demyelinating sensorimotor length dependent neuropathy with axonal features,
As there was concern for POEMS, a VEGF level was checked and this came back to be 29 pg/l normal 9-86). He was
evaluated with MRI lumbar spine and was also checked for renal stones, for the left sided flank pain which came back to
be unremarkable. The lambda light chains have increased from 7,8 TO 13.86 (0.57-2.63).
Since his last visit has he has been experiencing excessive pain, hence amyloidosis associated small fiber neuropathy was
also considered and the patient is evaluated by surgery for a fat pad biopsy.
Patient reports mild numbness involving all the toes of his feet for the past 15 years. He also reports mild orthostatic
hypotension related symptoms especially when he stands up from a sitting position rapidly. He also reports that his
mother also suffered orthostatic hypotension for long period of time. He denied any vision changes or hearing problems.
He also denied involvement of speech or dysphagia. There is no bowel or bladder involvement. He reports constipation
after use of oxycodone
Previous background history that led to the diagnosis of multiple myeloma is as follow. Patient was diagnosed to have
multiple myeloma after he was found to have an abnormal serum electrophoresis and immunofixation, IgG level is
elevated to 5981, (620 -1766), kappa 1.29 (0.33- 1.94 mg/deciliter) and lambda 7.48 (0.57-2.63)- M protein have reduced
from 4.9-0.5 after 4 cycles of chemotherapy. He was found to have elevated IgG lambda on serum immunofixation. He
had undergone a bone marrow biopsy on
2016 and that showed the presence of 36% plasma cells. Flow
cytometry showed 20% plasma cells and the biopsy showed diffuse interstitial plasma cells of greater than 60% Bone
survey has revealed 2 lytic lesions in his calvarium. Hemoglobin A1c 6.3, TSH 1.30, vitamin B12 398.

Dear Dr.
I had the pleasure of seeing your patient
for follow up in
NEUROLOGY PRACTICE. She returned for her EMG/NCS.
The EMG report is as follows:
Purpose: Evaluation of a year old left handed woman with a history of
connective tissue disease and progressive weakness. She developed
weakness of her right 5th digit in 1996. This progressed to involve more
fingers in early 2000s and her left hand in 2006. She has numbness in her
finger tips mainly. Her symptoms have progressed despite MMF. She has
a history of pulmonary hypertension and requires oxygen. She was recently
seen by Dr.
in mid-February, see note for full history. The
neurological examination shows there are normal EOM, tongue is midline.
There is no facial weakness. Neck flexion is normal. There is a significant
postural tremor. Strength testing reveals (R/L): Deltoid, biceps and triceps
5/5, WE 4-/3+, EDC 2/2, FDI/ADM 4/4, and APB 4/4. Lower extremity
testing reveals full power bilaterally. She is diffusely areflexic. There is
decreased pain sensation in the left leg in a stocking distribution. Sensory
testing in the upper extremity is normal except for light touch on right 2nd
digit. Vibration threshold is slightly decreased at the left great toe.
Query: Mononeuritis multiplex?
Procedure: Bilateral ulnar, median and left peroneal and tibial motor nerve
conduction studies (with F waves) were performed with surface electrodes.
Bilateral sural, superficial peroneal, median, ulnar and radial sensory nerve
conduction studies were also performed. EMG studies were performed
with concentric needle electrodes of the right upper extremity and the left
lower extremity.
Description: The results of nerve conduction studies are abnormal for: 1)
Name:
DOB:
Date:
P. 004/008
reduced amplitude of the right median compound muscle action potential
(CMAP), 2) absent left sural sensory nerve action potential (SNAP), 3) an
increase in bilateral median and bilateral distal motor latencies, 4) an
increase in left peroneal, tibial and bilateral median and right ulnar
minimum-F-wave latencies with and absent left ulnar F-wave, 5) prolonged
bilateral median, and right ulnar peak sensory latencies and 6) reduced left
median motor nerve conduction velocity at the axilla and the right ulnar
motor nerve conduction velocity in the forearm.
The results of EMG studies are abnormal for: 1) an increased incidence
of long duration motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) in the right deltoid,
bíceps, triceps, FDI, APB, left tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, vastus
medialis, iliopsoas muscles, and 2) reduced recruitment of MUAPs in the
right deltoid, triceps, EDC, FDI, APB, tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, vastus
medialis muscles.
IMPRESSION: These abnormal electrodiagnostic studies provide
evidence for a chronic predominantly motor and demyelinating
polyneuropathy with secondary axonal changes. Some of these
findings could in part also be related to cervical or lumbar
polyradiculopathies.
COMMENT: Further investigations will be initiated including lumbar
puncture, and possible spine imaging. Depending on these results nerve
biopsy may be pursued as well as consideration of CIDP treatment with
IVIG/PLEX. If considering a nerve biopsy, would recommend the left sural
nerve. Clinical correlation is advised.
The finding of a predominantly motor demyelinating neuropathy suggests
an inflammatory neuropathy akin to chronic inflammatory demyelinating
polyneuropathy (CIDP) although the concern for a mononeuritis multiplex
associated with her rheumatologic condition remains. To further evaluate
this the following tests have been ordered:

DIAGNOSTIC SUMMARY: He is a 53-year-old gentleman with increasing foot and leg numbness of 2
years' duration. Because of this electrodiagnostic studies were performed. EMG was performed of the
right upper extremity including the deltoid, biceps, triceps, first dorsal interosseous, and abductor pollicis
brevis muscles. All muscles are silent at rest. Showed normal motor unit amplitude, duration,
configuration, and recruitment. Nerve conduction studies, however, did show abnormalities. The left
median motor conduction had a terminal latency of 11.1 ms, an amplitude of 4.6 mV, and a conduction
velocity of 23.6 m/s. The left ulnar nerve had a terminal latency of 8.1 ms, amplitude of 4.3 mV, and
conduction velocities of 19 m/s. The right ulnar nerve maximum conduction velocity was 22.9 m/s with a
terminal latency of 9.8 mV. Motor conduction of the left tibial nerve gave no response. Sensory
conductions showed no response in the left ulnar, right median, and left median nerves. The right ulnar
did give a conduction velocity of 30.9 m/s. The left radial gave a conduction velocity of approximately 30
m/s and the right radial of 15.6 m/s. F waves were unreliably determined and were extremely prolonged in
all nerves tested.
SUMMARY: In summary this study shows evidence of very slow conduction in motor and sensory
nerves and is consistent with a demyelinating neuropathy which appears to be generalized. There is
involvement of motor and sensory conductions. This study is compatible with the clinical diagnosis of
chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.

356.9 IDIO PERIPH NEURPTHY
Impression and Plan:
The patient has an abnormally elevated Neuronal AchR, Ganglionic (Alpha-3)
antibody titer. Although considered in the ""low elevated"" range, there are
reported patients with this that had a significant demyelinating
polyneuropathy.
We will plan for a 5 day course of Vig infusions in hopes of restoring lower
extremity strength. As this antibody has been associated with several cancer
types, I will discuss a workup for occult malignancy with his primary care
provider. Follow-up will be arranged following IVlg treatment.

Patient Visit Note
Assessment
Suspected multifocal motor neuropathy. The age, gender, and clinical presentation are all
supportive of this. Nerve conduction studies, however, did not show conduction block or
other demyelinating findings. Alternatively, the patient may have an insidious motor neuron
disease. The patient does report sensory symptoms, but there are no objective sensory
findings on examination or nerve conduction testing. Therefore, I believe the differential is
multifocal motor neuropathy versus motor neuron disease.
Plan
Transition in care, clinical summary provided
1. Anti-GM 1 antibodies. Given the family history of amyloidosis biopsies do not know if this
was primary or secondary) and also checking for a TTR gene mutation.
2. Even if GM1 antibodies are absent, it is reasonable to proceed with a trial of treatment
with IVIG. I spoke to the patient in general terms, about IVIG. I will speak with him in more
detail after the test results are in.

Chief Complaint
The Chief Complaint is: Nerve damage in R arm and hand.
History of Present Illness
This is a -year-old man with progressive right upper extremity weakness. About 2 years
ago he noticed intermittent numbness in digits one through 3 in the right hand. This
ultimately became ""permanent."" In questioning about the numbness it is not clear whether
there is Truly numbness as opposed to just weakness. There has never been any positive
symptoms. There is no pain. In the
he noticed that he could not zip his son's
jacket. About a year later he had difficulty using a guitar pick and and playing the piano.
There are some tremors in the right hand. However there no muscle twitches or cramps.
There is no neck pain. The patient is left-handed.
He has had 2 extensive evaluations, one year apart, by Dr.
Nerve
conduction testing was unrevealing. EMG showed chronic denervation. Imaging of the
cervical spine, brachial plexus, and upper extremity neurography have all been
unremarkable.

CC: Peripheral Neuropathy
HPI: Mr.
is a ly.o, male with history of lumbar stenosis status post L4-L5 laminectomy, idiopathic
neuropathy who presents to Neuromuscular Clinic for a follow-up visit. He initially was referred for a second
opinion regarding burning, tingling, numbness and balance problems. Please refer to my prior notes for additional
details of clinical history and course.
Prior blood work completed and negative/normal for the following: B12, folate, HgbA1c, CBC, BMP, LFTs, Lyme,
ESR, CRP, ENA, ANCA, VDRL, SPEP, IFE, RF, TSH. ANA titer was borderline at 1:40 and fasting glucose was
initially 110 and then 101 when repeated.
Encc No. 7703ate: P. 17/2014
EMG completed in
demonstrated electrodiagnostic evidence for a mixed axonal and demyelinating
sensorimotor polyneuropathy (refer to formal report for details).
In the setting of progressive symptoms 10 years and negative work-up along with electrodiagnotics, a work-up for
hereditary neuropathy was completed and patient had CMT genetic testing at Diagnostics. The results
demonstrated a heterozygous intronic mutation in the FIG4 gene. Specific gene mutations in FIG4 are known to
cause CMT, however, the specific mutation identified has not been previously characterized and is of unknown
clinical significance.
As neuropathy has been progressive, I suggested possibly pursuing a sural nerve biospy to completely exclude an
immune-mediated neuropathy. I reviewed by overall suspicion for this and impression with patient and offered
pursuing a nerve biopsy at patient's last visit. Mr. after further researching this on his own would like to
continue to this investigation in hopes that if positive we would offer immunotherapy for condition (i.e., IVlg).
Patient reports slow progressive worsening but no significant change since last visit with me a few months ago.
Paresthesias persist and his Lyrica was increased from 75 mg BID to 150 mg BID. He states that his mood and
depression has worsened on higher dose. I reviewed several options with patient including reducing Lyrica dose
and transitioning Paxil to Cymbalta. He is agreeable to Lyrica dose reduction and will review with his PCP switching
Paxil to Cymbalta.
PMH: Lumbar stenosis status post L4-L5 laminectomy; HTN; hypercholesterolemia; dry eyes; former heavy

Autoantibodies to myeloperoxidase (MPO) are commonly
associated with the following small-vessel vasculitides:
microscopic polyangitis, polyarteritis nodosa,
Churg-Strauss syndrome, necrotizing and crescentic
glomerulonephritis and occasionally Wegeners
granulomatosis. The perinuclear IFA pattern, (p-ANCA)
is based largely on autoantibody to myeloperoxidase
which serves as the primary antigen.
These autoantibodies are present in active disease state.

RE:
DOB:
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: She is a -year-old patient of Dr
and Dr
She has no medication allergies. She has a longstanding history of diabetes since 2003, which
started as gestational diabetes but then turned into type 2 diabetes. She is on insulin therapy. History of
hypertension treated with lisinopril and peripheral neuropathy treated with Lyrica. Her diabetes has
not been under particularly good control in the past, but the patient states that it has been better lately
although we do not have any data to support this. Most recent blood sugar I have is from 2014 of 357
with an Alc of 9.3. Her vitamin D level was 11.8, and a thyroglobulin level of 3.6 was also elevated.
Because of her weakness, she apparently saw Dr who noticed atrophy in both hands involvingthe ulnar nerve 
distribution. The patient did have EMG and nerve conduction study performed by Dr
The findings did show somewhat increased latency of the sensory conductions of the median and
ulnar nerves with reduced amplitude in the ulnar nerves and slowed conduction velocity particularly
across the elbows bilaterally. There was also slowed conduction velocity in the peroneal nerve bilaterallyand no 
response in either tibial nerve. This finding was suggestive of multifocal areas of demyelinationand 
could indicate CIDP.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Positive for gallbladder surgery.
FAMILY HISTORY: Positive for diabetes in a brother.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She lives with her brothers. No tobacco, alcohol use at this time. Is a previous
smoker
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A 10-system review of the patient all negative except for leg swelling,
constipation, muscle weakness, numbness. Depression scale of 1 out of 6.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vital Signs: Height 76 inches tall, 300 pounds. Blood pressure is 140/100. Pulse is 72 and slightly
irregular.
General: She appears well developed, well nourished, well groomed. No obvious deformities.
Vascular: No carotid bruits. Pulses equal at the wrists.
Mental Status: Attention span and concentration normal. Short-term and long-term memory are normal.
Orientation to time, place, and person normal. Fund of knowledge and vocabulary normal.
Language: Spontaneous speech, repetition, and naming are normal.
Cranial Nerves: Visual fields and acuity normal. Funduscopic examination normal disks
and vessels. Extraocular movements full and conjugate. Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. Facial

movement strong and symmetric. Facial sensation normal and symmetric. Hearing normal to tuning fork
bilaterally. Palate elevation and tongue protrusion midline. Shoulder shrug strong and symmetric.
Motor: She is able to stand and walk but has slight waddling quality to her gait. Strength was basically
normal proximally and distally both upper and lower extremities. Muscle tone was normal. Muscle mass
showed significant loss in both feet and particularly in the ulnar aspect of both hands. No tremors were
noted or other abnormal movements except for a mild degree of generalized psychomotor slowing. Finemotor 
movements and finger-to-nose were done fairly well. Reflexes were basically 2+ and equal except
at the ankles where they were absent.
Sensory: Exam showed impairment particularly in the lower extremities to all modalities. This sensory
loss was predominantly from the ankle on down.
Meninges: No meningeal signs are noted.
In summary, she shows some clinical evidence of distal diabetic type of neuropathy involving her feet but
also has unexplained issues, particularly the bilateral ulnar atrophy in the hands. The entire picture fits
best with either a demyelinating neuropathy or a multifocal conduction neuropathy. I did not see any
fasciculations, and the patient does have some sensory symptoms making anterior horn cell disease
somewhat less likely. I think at the present time I would like to get some baseline diagnostic studies and
if nothing definite is found we will probably go ahead and treat her for CIDP with IVIG, but we will also
need to make sure that other risk factors for neuropathy, such as her diabetes and possible thyroid disease,
are kept under good control.
Plan to obtain additional blood work and, as soon as the workup is completed, proceed with getting
authorization for the IVIG therapy.
Followup will be in about 4 weeks.

RE:
DOB:
DOV:
Dear Dr.
I appreciate the referral of
for EMG nerve conduction testing of the bilateral upper
extremities.
As you know, she is a pleasant -year-old female. She is a diabetic. She has been told in the
past that she has neuropathy.
She has developed some progressive functional deficits over the course of the last 3 or 4 months.
She is not sure if she had any significant illness prior to the onset of these symptoms.
She has bilateral footdrop. She has profound atrophy of the hand intrinsics on both sides, much
more prevalent on the right.
On exam, she has a lot of distal weakness in both the arms and hands.
Detalled nerve conduction studies were undertukon limou all 4 limbs; results enclosed.
Needle examination bilaterally of the deltoid, triceps, biceps, brachioradialis, flexor carpi radialis,
and first dorsal interosseous were undertaken. The first dorsal interosseous, particularly on the left
showed spontaneous activity. On the right, this muscle was severely atrophied with decreased
insertional activity. She can only activate 1 motor unit on the right and it was polyphasic. She can
only actively 2 or 3 units on the left, also polyphesic.
The proximal muscles do not show acute denervation, but all show increase polyphasicity with
recruitment.
IMPRESSION: Profoundly abnormal study.
Clearly, she has advanced peripheral neuropathy, probably chronic inflammatory demyelinating
polyneuropathy or CIDP.
Superimposed on this, I believe she has developed bilateral median and ulnar neuropathies based
on the electrical findings today.
DISCUSSION: She does need to see Neurology about the CIDP. This could theoretically be
treatable by IVIG and I did speak with Dr. about her case and he was kind enough to seeher in the office 
for consultation to address those issues.
In my opinion, she should also fiave decompressive surgery for the median and uinar nerves at the
wrists and elbows respectively. It is impossible to say how much contribution the hand symptoms
are receiving from the compressive neuropathies, but in the sense that they are theoretically
treatable, I think it is worth a try as typically the prognosis for neurologic recovery from the CIDP is
not good.
She will be returning here to see you to discuss the results and she will be seeing Dr.
regarding the neuropathy.
Thank you for this very interesting consultation.
Sincerely,
Page 1 of 2

to schedule a follow-up visit with
2 wksafter IVIG.
Given the muscle bx results being neurogenic, the weakness and the GM1 antibody, We dicussed a trial of IVIG for
treatment of multifocal motor neuropathy. I reviewed the benefits/risks. We also discussed checking an MRI of the
cervical spine given the recent challenges with her lumbar spine. I will see her back after the first infusion. Will also

Progress Notes
Patient follows up for progressive weakness and atrophy, suspected due to MMN.
He began having symptoms at age 19. He had extensive evaluation by Dr
and Dr.
After last visit in
he had repeat NCS/EMG that showed a lot of chronic
denervation with active denervation on in the left FDI plus conduction block in the proximal portion of left ulnar
nerve. A trial of IVIG was proposed but he could not do it at the time. He comes back for follow up today
because he has had worsening weakness in his left hand and now in his right hand. He has no numbness. He
denies dysphagia, dysarthria. He has no orthopnea though he sometimes feels ""chest tightness"" or difficulty
getting his breath. He has asthma.
GM1 ab were negative.
EXAM see form
Impression
Probable MMN - will try IVIG.
We discussed the diagnosis, potential treatments, potential side effects of IVIG, and plan for treatment.
I would like to repeat his C spine MRI
Plan
1. Repeat C spine MRI to evaluate for any cervical cord lesion
2. Trial of IVIG
3. Creatinine/BUN baseline.
4. RTC in 2-3 months after his IVIG is initiated.
Time 50 minutes, 30 minutes counseling regarding the diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and coordinating care.

Progress Notes
is a 36 year old right handed patient here for follow up of slowly progressive LUE weakness
focal amyotrophy - probably Hirayama's. Last seen
mptoms seemed to progress slowly over about 3 years or so - first noted inability to extend fingers on left in
1995 at age 18 or 19 and slowly progressed over perhaps 3-4 years. His weakness had been stable
weakness for several years, but feels he has gotten worse this past year. He was taking rilutek for a long time
but stopped it in 2008. He previously stated that he ""felt better"" on it. He was never treated with steroids or
IVIG.
For the past year, he feels right arm is also becoming affected. He feels watches are looser/atrophy of arms.
He feels both arms are weaker. He notes loss of dexterity. He has tremor/shaking in both hands and
forearms, making it difficult to use a mouse. He wakes up a few times a week due to cramping in calves. He
feels shoulders are sore at times. No stiffness in arms. He does have muscle stiffness. He does note
ciculations for years. He denies dysphagia. He has occasional dysarthria (possibly just when over
ked/tired). No bowel/bladdder incontinence. Occasional constipation. He has numbness in left hand at
times. He does have tingling in bilateral tingling. No orthopnea, he does have asthma.
He injured right knee
had reconstruction
He also herniated two discs at that time.
Per notes he previously said lumbar MRI showed disc protrusions at L4-5 and L5-S1. He uses Naproxen for
pain.

I spoke to the patient yesterday by phone about EMG showing worse neuropathy compared with 3 weeks ago.
Both demyelinating and axonal. Particlar changes in teh peroneals, but tibials also involved, He feels about the
same.
This is likely an immune mediated neuropathy, or CIDP with both axona and demyalinating features.
Given that he has worsened progressively, he will require treatemnt with IVIĜ. THis was discussed with him and he
agrees.
0.4 grams per kilogram daily for 5 treatments then 0.4 grams per kilogram every 2 weeks for 6 doses.
Lyme testing negative on
HE also needs additional blood testing: B12, IEP, ESR, ČRP,

Chief Complaint
bilateral footdrop.
History of Present Illness
the patient was seen by Dr. and by me at normal hospital about 2 weeks ago when he presented with leg weakness. He had
diffuse leg weakness but the problem was significantly complicated by severe localized back pain.
Sterold injection above and below the surgcla site. Pain in the back now basically gone.
Working with physical therapy. He thinks that he was starting to realize foot weakness around September 3rd, couple days before
hospitalization. On exam in the hospital I did not find foot dorsiflexion weaknoss. EMG showed Nonspecific neuropathy,
moderato, attributed to diabetes.
since his surgery, ho has been relatively sedentary, more than usual and likes to sit and read for extended amount of time. He
habitually crosses one leg over the other, usually the right leg over the left leg and sits like this for hours at a time.
He does not have any changes in bladder or bowel function, no more back pain after the sterold Injections, and he thinks that his leg
weaknoss is at this time mostly in the feet, not proximally. He has some numbness and lack of sensation in the legs bilaterally
distally. He does not have any pain in the legs at this time.
Review of Systems
No fever. No chills. No recent visual change. No cough. No shortness of breath. No chest pain. No nausea. No change in
bladder or bowel habits. No bleeding. No joint pain. No rash. No headache.

Neurology Progress Note
Sensory: there was decreased pinprick, cold, and light touch sensation in the right lateral leg below the knee and to a lesser degroo the
right lateral thigh above the knee compared with his samo pattorn was prosent on the left side as well but less. Vibration was present at
the great toes bilaterally, better detected at the left than on the right. There was no Tinel's sign at the fibular heads bilaterally but right
popliteal pressure produced tingling in the toes on the right side.
Deep tendon reflexes: 2+ and symmetric throughout, except for bilateral absent ankles.
Coordination / Galt: No dysmetria on finger to nose testing. Galt was not tested.
eneral: No acute distress. It was was sitting with his right leg crossed over the left leg and in this position, the leg was basically
parallel to the floor. He demonstrated how he also crosses the left over the right and is not able to achleve parallel positioning to the
floor.
Impression and Plan
This 65-year-old gentleman with a background history of diabetes and hypertension currently has bilateral footdrop with no
dorsiflexion on the right side and 4/5 dorsiflexion on the left side. Otherwise his strength is Intact. He is about 3 months status
post a L4-5 lumbar laminectomy for spinal stenosis, Imaging of the lumbar spine for this problem rovoals no unexpected
postsurgical changes. he has sensory changes predominantly in the legs below the knee billaterally. He has absent ankle
reflexes which is probably due to his diabetes.
At this time I do not see any strong evidence for a generalized neuromuscular condition. Intact reflexes after several weeks of
symptoms would be not typical for Gulllain-Barré r CIDP, furthermore EMG testing about 2 weeks ago did not show what
appeared to be a predominantly demyelinating nouropathy,
1 observed the patient continuously crossing one leg over the other during this visit and this was pointed out. I think his problem may
be a common peronoal strotch injury because of habitual leg crossing. He crosses the right leg over the loft more frequently than
the opposite direction and spends many more hours per day in this position since the surgery, as he has been relatively more
sedentary. He may be a setup for a simple stretch injury in light of what is probably an underlying diabetic neuropathy.
This would be a nice explanation for bilatoral foot drop since that he avoids the leg positioning he would be expacted to make a full
recovery.
I will refer him for a repeat EMG studies early next week for a second look at whether there is any evidence of a progressive
neuropathy, demyelinating neuropathy, and also to specifically conduct across the fibular heads to try to confirm peroneal
neuropathy at this location do to stretch injury.
I agree with his boing sent for an AFO brace on the right side for the time being which will help him functionally.
I will see him in followup in a couple of weeks

Chief Complaint
fatigue, orthostatic dizziness
HPI
Dear Dr.
Ms
is a-year-old that returns for ongoing management of a post-lyme dysautonomic and right-sided
neuralgia syndrome. She is still awaiting approval by her insurance of IVIG therapy offered last appointment. She
admits to improved mentation with lowering gralise to 2400mg QHS (from 3000mg), however her right sided
neuropathic pain is spiking more frequently such that taking percocet daily. She also complains that ""food stresses
(her) system"" with an increase in fatigue and dizziness as well as early satiety and bloating with meals. Her
orthostatic dizziness persists such that again voices frustration with ""only able to stand (and tend to her daughter) for
a few minutes at a time"" though ""at least can do that (taking midodrine and pyridostigmine)...those medications are
helping without headache like northera (induced)"".
ROS
10-point review is notable for difficulty maintaining her weight due to poor appetite.

Neurological Exam
Well-appearing, albeit thin, -year-old female in no apparent distress. HEENT normal; neck supple; lungs clear;
abdomen benign; no extremity edema. No joint tenderness, disfigurement or swelling. Fingers mildly erythematous
distally.
Alert, fully oriented and absent any language deficits or dysarthria. Equal pupils reactive to light; intact extraocular
movements without nystagmus or diplopia; intact visual fields to confrontation; no facial asymmetry or weakness;
intact facial sensation and lower cranial nerves. Trace right pronator drift; otherwise full (5/5) strength throughout;
symmetrical 1+ DTRS with flexor bilateral plantar responses. Sensory testing notable for trace dysasthesia in right
arm and leg compared to left side. Gait is normal.
Previous Tests
4/2/13: emg-ncv (artz) with no evidence for a sensorimotor (large fibe) polyneuropathy of the upper limbs; no
evidence for motor neuronal or axonal neuropathy of right arm (described as weak) [reports scanned into emr].
10/8/12: Lyme IgM western blot positive (see scanned report), IgG negative, IFA B Burg. g/m/a titer 40 (equivocal).
5/30/14: ANA neg, c3 (low) 88, RA 19.8 (0-13.9), factor V leiden negative; crp 0.8, cmp normal, SIEP normal,
CBC normal, ft4 1.24, tsh 1.01, b12 395, ferritin (low) 12, ionized calcium 5.0; vid25oh 22.9.
8/6/13: autonomic testing (full battery/Stanford) most notable for deep breathing heart rate 7,6,4.9 (N>11) E:I ratio
1.12, 1.07 (N>1.17); Q-SART response amplitude was very low over the forearm and proximal leg. Other responses
were absent. Tilt showed significant orthostatic changes (SBPdrop 23mm below baseline; HR increased 38 beats
above baseline; she became dizzy and lightheaded immediately after HUT. She described leg weakness at 5 minutes
and numb feet and toes after 8 minutes. Vasomotor pooling appeared in the feet about 8 minutes after tilt. c/w mild
to moderate autonomic neuropathy involving sympathetic sudomotor, cardiovascular and vasomotor fibers. There is
also mild to moderate parasympathetic involvement. Tilt c/w mild orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia;
composite autonomic scoring scale 5/10.
Reviewed recent repeat autonomic studies at and remain mild to moderately severe and unchanged
compared to 1 year prior (recommend recheck in 1 1/2 years).
Assessment
This 45-year-old special education teacher and mother of a 17-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter returns with a
refractory autonomic insufficiency/thalamic pain syndrome that warrants a therapeutic/diagnostic trial of IVIG
given her severe symptomatology despite polypharmacy. IVIG is a proven therapy in CIDP, a similar neurological
syndrome.
Recommendations
1) vitamin D3 2000 IU daily; target >50
2) cook on iron skillet; target ferritin>50
(3) gralise 2400mg QHS; add gabapentin 200mg daily for 1 week then BID for 1 week then TID thereafter
4) percocet 5/325mg daily prn severe pain
5) Trial IVIG (nufactor), 2 grams/kg over 3 days q4 weeks for 3 doses
6) consider next visit discontinuing pyridostigmine in favor of a second trial of northera, but dosed 100mg QAM

patient was very healthy until approximately 1 year ago. He began developing and paresthesias in thetoes followed 
by paresthesias in the upper extremities with an weeks of each other. He subsequentlydeveloped 
weakness in the upper and lower extremities. He feels like his balance is off. If he closeshis eyes or 
looks up he will fall almost immediately. He has noted weakness in the hip girdle muscles.Trouble get an 
upper out of the chair out of the car up and down stairs. He has not had dysphasiadysarthria 
double-vision or eyelid ptosis. His symptoms have continued to progress. He is no longerable to do buttons easily 
or fine motor tasks. He does describe burning dysesthesias in the feet worsewith lying down and 
sheets her other clothing touching them. Overall this tolerable for now. Doesnotice a 
cramping feeling in the right hand. His handwriting has degraded as well as his ability to type.Does not have radiating 
cervical pain her back pain no bowel or bladder incontinence. No toxicexposure or significant 
illness prior to the onset of symptoms that he can identified. Patient wasreferred to 
the Neurology locally. Blood test revealed an IGG M spike is 0.3. He was referred toHematology 
who felt like this was a very low level IgG in recommended following the blood test overtime. No bone marrow biopsy. 
Patient had EMG nerve conduction studies in

IgG kappa M spike 0.35.
EMG nerve conduction studies
revealed significant demyelinating peripheral
neuropathy that appears segmental in nature, Conduction blocks.
Assessment and Plan
is a
y.o. male With subacute progressive motor and sensory neuropathy beginning
year ago. He does have significant distal in some proximal weakness. EMG nerve conduction study
shows significant demyelinating peripheral neuropathy. This is all consistent with CIDP. Recommend
lumbar puncture to improve elevated protein. At that point will start IVIG 0.5 grams per kilogram perday x4 day 
followed by a 0 point by grams per kilogram per day x2 days every 3 weeks until follow up.Also have 
him return here for nerve conduction studies to get a better idea of the segmental nature ofthe 
peripheral neuropathy. The below blood test will be sent to look for mimics of CIDP. He does have
IgG MGUS but a very low M spike. Likely not related. Continue to follow with hematology for this.
Greater than 50% of the 60 minute appointment was face-to-face time spent counseling the patient,
discussing the symptoms, workup, diagnosis, and treatment options.

Chief Complaint
is a
year old woman with numbness, paresthesias, pain, impaired balance - sjogrens SFN.
History of Present Illness
Ms.
is a year old woman with lupus/sjogrens since 2003 (joing pain, thyroid, fatigue) - prior treatment steroids, cellcept,
methotrexate, now just plaquenil for the past year, here for follow up of worsening numbness in the hands and feet with Impaired
balance - small fiber neuropathy likely related to her rheumatologic disorder. Medical history also notable for ischemic colitis, renal
cell and cervical cancer both treated; vaginal dysplasia being monitored.
Since her last visit, skin biopsy showed low-normal ENFD at the thigh consistent with small fiber neuropathy. Higher does
gabapentin working ok. Labs for neuropathy unrevealing for alternative source but paraneoplastic panel still pending. No new
neurological symptoms.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
is a -year-old
male, who was referred to me by Dr.
for evaluation of bilateral
arm numbness and pain. At the time of his last visit, we were impressed
with the possibility that this may be bilateral proximal median
neuropathy, which his sensory disturbance is entirely in the
distribution of the median nerve. He also had weakness of the thumb
abductors and that is the concern as well as median neuropathy.
Subsequent to his last visit, he underwent an EMG nerve conduction
study. This was performed on
by Dr.
and Dr.
The bilateral median and radial sensory nerve responses sowed reduced
amplitudes, the left median response also showed a 50% reduction in
amplitude compared to the right median sensory response. The bilateral
ulnar sensory responses were normal and the right median and ulnar
comparative, mixed motor and sensory studies revealed a peak latency
difference of 0.2, which is normal, however, the left median motor
response showed a partial conduction block, The amplitude dropped from
8.8-2.6 and this is more than 50% drop across the segment. The
conduction and amp area was not as prominent, however, the conduction
velocity remained normal at 51. The right median responses did not show
any such change. The median F waves were all were prolonged on the left
side with F-wave latency of 41.4 and distal latency was normal at 3.2.
The EMG study showed denervation 1+ fibrillation potentials that the
pollicis longus on both left and right side a fair number of the motor
unit modeling changes in multiple muscles. The conclusion for this
study was electrophysiological evidence for bilateral proximal median
neuropathies, proximal to the takeoff of the pronator teres, which was
left worse than the right. In the meantime, he continues to have mainly
sensory symptoms. He does not per say complain of much in the way of
motor deficit, but his main problem is pain and feeling of burning and
tingling in the median distribution. In the interim, he also got stung
by a bee around his right eye with significant right eye swelling. He
is under treatment for that.

IMPRESSION: Mr.
year-old gentleman with bilateral
median neuropathies by clinical exam as well as by electrophysiological
examination. These are proximal median neuropathy, left much worse on
the right. I am not fully convinced of the right median neuropathy, but
he clearly has sensory disturbance that with the left one is quite
obvious.
Given the bilateral median distribution as well as possible ulnar
sensory neuropathies and possibility of an hereditary neuropathy such as
HNPP needs to be considered, but would be very unusual given the very
prominent positive sensory symptomatology. This may very well be a
Lewis-Sumners variant of CIDP given the focal conduction blocks, and
motor and sensory deficits. We have sent off the motor and sensory
neuropathy antibody study to
to look for any
possible nerve autoantibodies. I am recommending an MRI of bilateral
forearms in humerus to look for any focal lesions or any signal changes
that may suggest inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy; however, at this
point, I would like to go ahead and treat him with IVIG since it is
clearly demyelinating disorder going on. The IVIG dose would be 2 g/kg
loading dose followed by 1 g/kg every 3 weeks for the next 3 months. We
asked him to return back to clinic. Follow up maybe a little bit
difficult since he has predominantly sensory symptoms and more objective
findings less, however, he does have conduction block on the nerve
conduction and that can be used for followup purposes as well.
Thank you once again for allowing me to participate in the care of Mr.
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or
concerns.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr.
is a year-old,
male, who was referred by Dr.
for further evaluation.
His problems started with his right hand in 2002. His problems
initially started with elbow pain, which radiated into the hand, and the
pain started below the elbow and never radiated up. It was horrible.
pain with his arms ache for 3 weeks and then he woke up one morning with
paralyzed right hand with paralysis of the right thumb, index finger,
and partial paralysis of the middle finger. There was also a sensory
loss in the same hand, which extended into the median innervated fingers
as well as thenar eminence. He describes the numbness as tremendous
numbness. All of this resolved within 6-8 month; however, 8-9 months
later, she had similar problems with the left side, exactly the same
thing, extremely painful paralysis, resolved after long time which took.
about a year and a half, and since then, both the hands have gotten
better; however, late summer, both hands started getting worse again.
He has constant pain, cannot move, cannot use his hands, cannot write,
cannot type. His arms shake, and he has decreased fine motor strength,
He has recurrence of numbness in the first 3 fingers down to the thenar
eminence. Denies any numbness in the ulnar distribution. Denies
numbness in the forearm or arm, and denies any problems with her legs.
He does not feel that his grip is weak, but only his ability to use his
index fingers and flex his index fingers has decreased. He had previous
testing done by Dr.
The nerve conduction study that
Mr.
brought with him done by Dr.
suggested a conduction
block in the median nerve across the forearm. He has MRIs done of the
brain, which showed no evidence of acute intracranial event. He also
had a CT scan of the head, which did not show any hemorrhage but showed
mastoid effusions.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for measles and chickenpox as a
child. He has history of asthma and high blood pressure and had
previous hospitalization for pneumonia. His vaccination is up to date.
with the flu vaccine in 2013 and Pneumovax in 2010 and a tetanus in
2010. He has had previous surgery for tympanoplasty and hernia, one in
1992, one in 1962.
ALLERGIES: HE IS ALLERGIC TO POLLEN, AIR POLLUTION, SOME FOODS
INCLUDING NUTS, AND SOME ANIMALS INCLUDING HORSES. HE IS ALSO ALLERGIC

Re:
Dear
Thank you very much for referring your patient, Mr.
for neurological
evaluation. He was seen on
accompanied by his wife of 43 years and his son,
Lenny. This year-old right-handed married man is a retired cemetery landscape with history
of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for which he takes Doxazosin (4 mg); Lisinopril (20
mg); HCTZ (25 mg); Simvastatin (10 mg); and Aspirin.
three years. This began on the
right side around the shoulder with some associated neck pain. This was initially felt to be due to
cervical radiculopathy but MRI of the cervical spine
showed moderate
degenerative changes especially at C6/C7 and old right cerebellar lesion.
Weakness spread to the left arm and descended toward both hands. The pain is aware of certain
milestones such as loss of inability of extending his fingers earlier this year.
Cervical and brain MRI scans were repeated again on
and again showed
moderate cervical spondylosis without cord compression or intraparenchymal lesions such as
syrinx. The superior cerebellar cyst, perhaps was again seen and lumbosacral MRI
showed L1 vertebral collapse.
Over the last year the patient had developed proximal weakness in the legs with occasional falls:
He denies change in speech or swallowing. There is no significant weight loss.
General Physical Examination:
BP: 130/80 mmHg. Heart is regular (80s). No carotid bruits. Slightly reduced neck range of
motion without tenderness. The range of motion in both shoulders is reduced in elevation (frozen
shoulder).
Neurological Examination:
Mentation and Speech: Normal.
No. 7142 P. 15
Re:
Page 2
Cranial nerves: Extraocular movements and visual fields are full. Eye closure is normal. There
is moderate weakness of lateral tongue movements (more to the right than the left) and the gag is
reduced. He has mild weakness of neck flexion (4/5) with preservation of extension,
Motor: There is striking, wasting of both shoulder girdles and arms (proximal more than distal)
none of the proximal arm groups resist gravity (1-2/5). Wrist extensors resist gravity (3/5) but
finger extensors do only on the right (3/5) but not the left (2/5). Both grasps are weak (3/5).
Hip flexion is moderately weak (4/5) but distal strength is normal.
Reflexes are absent in the arms, brisk at the knees, and normal at the ankles. Bilateral Babinski
responses are present.
Coordination: Difficult to assess but no obvious dystaxia,
Sensation: Normal in the arms and hands to pin and vibration. Vibration and pin are slightly
reduced to the feet to the ankle. Romberg is negative.
Gait: Slightly shortened strides. Slight waddle at the waist. No arm swing.
Impression:
1. Probable Motor Neuron Disease (APLS).
Plan:
1.
2.
3.
To review the cervical and brain MRI images.
To perform electrodiagnostic studies of both arms and one leg.
To review recent blood work which should include CK (CPK), aldolase, B12, Lyme
titer, ESR, CRP, and routines,
will need to
If the nerve conduction studies suggest any degree of conduction block,
have anti-GM1 antibody studies.
Thank you once again for this challenging and fascinating referral and for your confidence. If
you have any questions, or if I can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to call.

NCV FINDINGS:
Evaluation of the Left Median motor nerve showed reduced amplitude. The Right Median motor nerve
showed no response (Wrist). The Left Ulnar motor nerve showed prolonged distal onset latency, reduced
amplitude, decreased conduction velocity. The Right Ulnar motor nerve showed prolonged distal onset
latency, reduced amplitude, and decreased conduction velocity. All remaining nerves were normal.
The Left Median and Right Ulnar F Waves are absent.
EMG FINDINGS:
Needle evaluation of the Right and left APB, ExtDigCom, 1stDorInt, Biceps, and Deltoids showed
moderate spontaneous activity and discrete recruitment patterns consisting of normal appearing motor units.
Fasciculations were not prominent. The Right AntTibialis, MedGastroc, and the Right VastusLat showed
scattered spontaneous activity and reduced recruitment. Paraspinal muscles were normal.
COMMENT: The above electrophysiological findings reveal the presence of a motor neurone disease with
features atypical of A.L.S. including slowing of conduction, absent late responses, possible conduction
block, and absence of fasiculations and giant motor units. Consider multifocal motor neuropathy with
conduction block associated with anti-GM1 antibody.
Thank you for the courtesy of this referral.

returns for further consideration. He has worsened further since seen before. He underwent nerve and
muscle biopsy, hamstring and sural. The sural shows some signs of demyelination and axonal loss but the teased
fiber myelin findings exceed 20% so are supportive of a general demyelinating process. No other underlying cause
found, though his CK is mildly elevated as is the IgA. He notes increasing trouble walking and balance. He has no
notable pain but falls occasionally. Not yet using a cane. Mild tremor. No cranial symptoms.

Discussion/Summary
Sural biopsy and proximal and distal weakness now highly supportive of CIDP despite the negative slowing on
NCS. Discussed treatment at length.
plans further EM on nerve but progression dictates a treatment trial
of IVlg. We discussed the risks to renal and clotting and side effects of infusion. Will proceed with ICE protocol of
2g/kg induction and then 1 g/kg every 3 weeks and return after 2 months. Will proceed with treatment. Diagnostic
basis supported by proximal and distal weakness and nerve biopsy support.
Attending Attestation
I spent 30 minutes of face to face time with the patient, 20 minutes of counseling/coordination with the patient.
Discussion: Diagnostic possibilities, IVlg risks and side effects, alternative treatments such as steroids, prognosis,
expectations for recovery, answering posed questions.

I saw
today in follow up. He is a 60 year old gentleman with sensory loss and
pain, at last visit, we discussed the following:
IMPRESSION:
1. Asymmetrical Progressive Neuropathy
2. S/p cervical decompression
3. cervicocephalgia
Comment:
i reviewed Dr
NCS from
There is conduction block of the right peroneal nerve
and focal slowing of the above knee segment of the left peroneal nerve. There is prolonged
latencies of the tibial motor responses. These are new since our study in 2012 and are suggestive
of a generalized demyelinating neuropathy such as CIDP.
Also consider vasculitic neuropathy.
Recalls having multiple lumbar punctures at years ago for prolonged illness and disability.
Found elevated CSF protein every time per pt. Saw Dr no evidence of MS or Lyme disease.
I recommend the following:
1) EMG of the arms to confirm CIDP
2) Lumbar puncture for CSF protein
3) IVIG if abnormal
He is here today to discuss results of EMG and therapy.

Status: Signed
The patient returns for neurologic followup regarding her CIDP. She is on 60 mg of prednisone
a day. She has had a definite improvement on the prednisone but has had tremendous amount
of weight gain.
Her medical insurance plan through
will be canceled in July as they are
apparently canceling all individual plans. She still has longstanding severe problems with
insomnia. She did identified primary care physician who is med monitoring her glucose and
electrolytes. We received lab from last week in those all look normal. On examination, she has
a mild gait ataxia. She has good strength throughout except for -1 weakness of the hip flexors
and ankle dorsiflexors bilaterally. She is areflexic throughout. She has moderately impaired
joint in vibratory sensation in the feet with mildly impaired pinprick sensibility. At this point we
will go ahead and we try her on IVIG infusions. We will do a 5 day course and then repeat with
a 3 day course in 1 month. I will cut her prednisone and 40 mg a day. Pending on her
response, we may consider adding Imuran as we continue to taper her off of prednisone. Total
of 45 min was spent with her with 35 min counseling her regarding her condition and its
management.

RE:
Dear Dr.
Thank you for referring Mr.
a 27-year-old man who was doing
marshal arts about four months ago and felt fine after the exercises but the next
day he awoke up with some pain on the right side of his lower back as well as
numbness and tingling over the dorsal aspect of the right foot and the lateral
aspect of the right calf. He also noticed a partial right footdrop. He was dragging
his right foot. The back pain went away within five days but he still is dragging
his right foot and he has persistent numbness at the dorsal aspect of the right
foot and the lateral aspect of the right calf. He was referred here today for an
evaluation with EMG and nerve conduction studies. He denies any left-sided
symptoms. He denies any numbness or tingling in the upper extremities.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Weight, appetite and energy are stable. He has no
gastrointestinal, cardiac, respiratory, ENT, other musculoskeletal, dermatologic,
endocrine or psychiatric symptoms. He has had complaints of left testicular
pains in the past month. He went to see a urologist who prescribed Cipro, but he
only took few pills because he did not think that he had an infection. Urinalysis
was unremarkable. Testing for chlamydia was negative. He had an ultrasound
of the testes that showed a moderate left varicocele.
PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY: He was diagnosed with stomach
ulcer in the past. He had a negative colonoscopy investigating blood in his stool
in the past. At the age of 14, he had a splenic injury, which was managed
medically.

SOCIAL HISTORY: He drinks alcohol in moderation. There is no history
of drug use. He does not smoke. He works in advertising.
FAMILY HISTORY: He has a sister who has had a series of knee
arthroscopies. Both parents are well.
MEDICATIONS:
He is on no medications.
ALLERGIES:
He has no known allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Pulse was 72 and regular.
Blood pressure was 110/70. Respiratory rate was 12.
The patient appeared well. He was fully oriented with normal concentration,
memory and language.
Examination of the cranial nerves showed normal pupillary responses, visual
fields, optic fundi and eye movements. The remaining cranial nerves were all
normal including hearing.
Examination of the neck showed full range of movement with no bruits, masses,
thyromegaly or adenopathy. Auscultation of the heart and lungs was normal.
There was no organomegaly or adenopathy.
Examination of the extremities showed normal tone throughout. Tendon reflexes
were all absent apart from trace ankle jerks, which could only be obtained with
reinforcement. All other tendons reflexes were absent. All muscles
demonstrated normal strength apart from reduced 4+/5 right ankle dorsiflexion
strength and reduced 3/5 strength of the right toe extensors and the right
extensor hallucis longus. The right extensor digitorum brevis muscles were felt
atrophied on the dorsal aspect of the right foot. The patient demonstrated normal
strength of right ankle plantar flexion, eversion and right ankle inversion. He was
not able to walk on his right heel but he could walk on the toes of both feet.
Coordination tests with finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin were normal. Sensory
tests with pin, cold, vibration and proprioception were all normal apart from
reduced pin sensation over the dorsal aspect of the right foot and the lateral
aspect of the right calf, consistent with either a right common peroneal or right L5
dermatomal sensory loss. Pedal pulses were intact. Plantar responses were
flexor. Straight leg raising signs were negative. Coordination tests with finger-to-
nose and heel-to-shin were normal. Phalen's, Hoffmann's and Tinel's signs were

LABORATORY TESTS: There were no laboratory tests available for me to

IMAGING STUDIES:
review.
There were no imaging studies available for me to
ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL FINDINGS: Sensory motor and late
responses were recorded from both lower extremities. There was evidence of
right peroneal motor conduction block between the ankle and right fibular head
associated with moderate right peroneal motor conduction velocity slowing. The
right distal peroneal motor response latency was also mildly prolonged. There
was slight prolongation of the left distal tibial motor response latency. The left
peroneal compound muscle action potential response amplitudes were mildly
reduced. There was very mild left peroneal motor conduction velocity slowing
between the ankle and left fibular head. There was no evidence of right peroneal
motor conduction block across the fibular head with recording from the right
tibialis anterior. The right peroneal F-waves were absent with a single repeating
F-wave. Left peroneal F-waves were very prolonged. The tibial F-waves were
within normal limits. The tibial H-reflexes were bilaterally prolonged, more on the
right than the left side. The sural sensory response amplitudes were in the low
normal range but the distal sural sensory responses were absent as were the
bilateral superficial peroneal, saphenous and left mixed medial plantar sensory
response. I was able to obtain a small but still intact right mixed medial plantar
sensory response.
Needle EMG of muscles in both lower extremities and the right L5/S1 paraspinal
muscles showed mild fibrillations or positive sharp waves. There were no
fibrillations or positive sharp waves in any other muscle. There was severely
reduced, discrete recruitment of mildly enlarged and prolonged motor units in the
right extensor digitorum brevis and there was also similarly reduced recruitment
of slightly prolonged motor units in the right extensor hallucis longus. There was
also normal recruitment of mildly prolonged motor units in the bilateral tibialis
anterior and the left extensor hallucis longus. All other muscles were normal
including proximal right L5 innervated limb muscles as well as the right tibialis
posterior, short head of the right biceps femoris and the right L5/S1 paraspinals.
IMPRESSION: There was electrophysiological evidence of a demyelinating
lesion of the right deep peroneal nerve between the ankle and fibular head.
There was also electrophysiological evidence of a distal sensory predominantly
axonal polyneuropathy with some asymmetry because of the intact right mixed
medial plantar sensory response.

I am suspicious that the patient may have early signs of a multifocal acquired
sensory motor predominantly demyelinating polyneuropathy, possibly Lewis-
Sumner syndrome. I sent some baseline blood tests today and he is going to
come back in a few days to have a spinal tap done to see if his CSF protein is
elevated. I will probably treat him with intravenous immune globulin pending
results of the spinal tap and blood tests. I will be in touch with you regarding the
results of these tests.
Yours sincerely,
M.D.

History of Present Illness
Dear
Ms.
s a 67 y/o woman with about 8 months history of rather fast progressing bilateral feet and hands numbness, tingling
and balance issues. The symptoms started in the left foct and transferred to the right, a few months later the hands. In July she also
started noticing muscle weakness and her balance became so poor that she could not walk any more and currently she is in a
whee chair. She states that she has no control over her hands. She denies shortness of breath, muscle cramping or twitching. She
admits to some pain in the calves but nothing significant. Denies any dysarthrla, dysphagia, diplopia.
She has lost nearly 20 lbs for the last year.
She has been seen by two other neurologists. Had MRI brain and C-spine. Brain shows some diffuse atrophy, C-spine moderate
spinal stenosis. She was also evaluated by neurosurgery and apparently they did not fill that this is the cause of her symptoms.
EMG/NCS demonstrated severe predomirantly sensory neuropathy. Blood work was equivocal for paraneoplastic Ab. Whole body
PET scan and CT chest showed two small nodules of urcertain significance in her lungs.(she is a smoker). Trial with Prednisone
50mg daily for a month failed to improve her symptoms.

I tried to repeat an EMG today but stopped because I felt that I was not getting a technically adequate examination
and therefore I will, instead, ask for a second opinion subspecialty consultation with Dr. on this patient
with clinical progression to distal weakness and abnormalities on NCV and EMG. He may have both radiculopathy
and neuropathy. He does not have obvious spinal stenosis on imaging. Possibly he needs a more aggressive

Detall Type Description
Assessment Inflammatory neuropathy (357.89).
Impression He remains with a profound neuropathy and given the gammopathy noted in the lab, I
recommended a hematology evaluation. He may need a bone marrow bx. I also recommended a
more prolonged course of Iof 
IVIG to better assess efficacy. We also discussed how his DM may be
playing a role IVIG discussed in detail as well including SES. Will get screening labs.
Plan Orders CBC and CMP to be performed prior to IVIG. Today's instructions / counseling include(s) IVIG

We suggest clinical correlation to ascertain the
significance of the low titers.
Antibodies against glycolipids (GM1, GDla, GDib, Golb,
asialo GM1, and sulfatides) are present in patients with
Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), IgM paraproteinemic
neuropathy, and chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP).
Antibodies to one or more glycolipids are present in 60-70%
of patients with GBS. The titers of anti-glycolipid
antibodies are higher in acute phase and decrease in
association with clinical improvement. Antibodies against
GM1 and/or GD1b are frequently present in acute phase GBS.
The two antibodies together occur in about 20% of these
cases, anti-GM1 without anti-GDlb antibodies in about 10%
and anti-GD1b without anti-GM1 antibodies in about 10% of
GBS patients. Antibodies against Golb of IgG isotype are
present in 95% of patients with Miller Fisher syndrome
(MFS). The titers of these antibodies fluctuates with
disease activity. IgM paraproteinemia is often associated
with peripheral neuropathies. These antibodies are present
in one half of patients with specificity for SGPG, GD1b and
other gangliosides. Anti-GM1 IgM antibodies are usually
associated with motor-dominant or sensorimotor neuropathies.
These antibodies are also elevated in diseases other than
multifocal neuropathies such as GBS, CIDP and other
immunological diseases.

CHIEF COMPLAINT/REASON FOR VISIT:
Neurological reevaluation Sjogren's syndrome with encephalopathy and
autonomic neuropathy.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
is a pleasant 40-year-old female who returns for neurological
reevaluation regarding her complicated medical history which includes
Sjogren's syndrome, autonomic neuropathy, as well as gastrointestinal
dysfunction.
has in the interim since my last visit in
February of this year gone to
where the diagnosis of Sjogren
syndrome was confirmed. She saw 1 of the neurologists there,
Dr.
who did not have much to add. She was felt to not have adrenal insufficien
by Endocrinology. There was no suggested change by Rheumatology with her
immune-modulating medication regimen.
We initiated IVIG in March of this year with amazingly good benefit.
Ms.
was having dramatic symptoms at that time and she experienced
marked improvement on IVIG. She received 5 consecutive doses and then we
recommended a course of every-other-week treatment for a total of 14 doses.
She has at times however had a flare-up in symptoms. Never has this been a
prominent or sustained it has that was an eight-day period last week.

Ms.
comes in today feeling quite good actually. She did however
have an 8-day period where she was profoundly encephalopathic. She indicat
that she does not recall much from that episode. Her mother-in-law is with.
her. She indicates that she had headache, chest pain, abdominal pain. She
indicates that she felt as if she was drunk for about eight days. She was
unable to speak clearly. She was unable to do things such as e-mail clearl
She had terrible double vision and would sees spots.
Her behavior was
bizarre and her responses were not normal. For example, she would get up i
the middle of dinner and fix a salad and insists that everybody eat the
salad. She also reported having terrible headaches. Currently, she feels
quite good. She has a little bit of nausea. She has no headache. Her
thinking is fairly clear. Her vision is not normal, however. She has some
diplopia, though reports that this is much better than it was last week.
Her weight has been stable since August. She did lose 32 pounds from May t
August. She indicates that she is not getting much exercise.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Motrin 800 mg daily.
Dexamethasone 0.75 mg twice weekly.
Cymbalta 60 mg daily.
Evoxac 30 mg one to three times daily.
Plaquenil 200 mg 1 once to twice daily.
Vitamin D 50,000 international units weekly.
Ambien CR 12.5 mg daily.
Aleve 220 mg p.r.n.
Imitrex.
Amerge p.r.n.
Vitamin C.
Iron.
PHYSICAL EXAM:
Neurological Examination: Weight 57.7 kg. Speech is normal without any
evidence of dysarthria. On cranial nerve examination, there is definite
impairment with inferior oblique, so there is impairment in right upward an
medial gaze.
The remainder of the cranial nerve examination was
unremarkable. Manual muscle strength testing is normal in the upper and
lower extremities.
Deep tendon reflexes are moderately with without Hoffma
signs in the upper extremities, similarly brisk in the lower extremities wi
2 beats of clonus bilaterally. Plantar responses are however flexor. Musc
tone is normal. AMRS were normal. The sensory examination was normal,
Ga :
and limb coordination was normal.
IMPRESSION/REPORT/PLAN:
1. Sjogren's syndrome.
2. Recurrent encephalopathy versus aseptic meningitis secondary to Sjogren
syndrome.
3. History of autonomic neuropathy--gastrointestinal dysmotility and
orthostatic intolerance, presumably secondary to Sjogren's syndrome.
History of bilateral median neuropathies at the wrists, mild.
4.
PRINTED
PAGE 2 OF 3
From
Page:20/24
5.
6.
History of headaches.
History of periodic limb movements of sleep.
I suspect that all or most of this is secondary to Sjogren's syndrome. I
suspect that this is a recurrent encephalopathy or, alternatively, aseptic
meningitis resulting from Sjogren's. I do not think that this is all
migrainous phenomena. I have recommended the following: (1) Spinal fluid,
examination; 2) laboratory studies; 3) visual evoked potentials; 4) EEG. IM
is interested in establishing care with Rheumatology here. We wi
order that.
Ultimately, I suspect that we will give a 3-consecutive-day course of IVIG
and increase the frequency of that medication. I am not going to do anythi
further with headaches at this point, as it is my feeling given the entire
clinical picture that the headaches are likely a manifestation of Sjogren's
Code on this is a 99215.

RE:
with the
I saw
a 63 yo WF in follow up today. She was last seen on
following impression:
IMPRESSION:
1) Bibrachial weakness and hand wasting
2) Cervical myelopathy
3) axonal and demyelinating neuropathy
Comment:
The lumbar puncture is abnormal, showing a very high CSF protein >460, suggestive of Froins
Syndrome. This may indicate a CS block or intraspinal tumor. There was no cellularity to suggest
meningeal tumor. The GM1 is negative, but the MAG antibody is slightly elevated.
She has not yet had the CT myelogram or a follow up visit with Dr
I think her injuries
are most likely due to cervical myelomalacia worsened by a CSF block. If CT myelogram is
negative, consider an autoimmune process such as bibrachial CIDP, Multifocal motor neuropathy,
or bibrachial variant of ALS. The hand wasting is out of proportion to the degree of leg spasticity for
cervical myelomalacia, I would not expect her to be able to walk independently.
I recommend the following:
1) Follow through on the CT myelogram Friday and visit with Dr
2) If negative, will recommend a course of IVIG
3) IFE, SPEP
4) metastatic bone survey
More than half of 40 minutes was spent discussing the pathophysiology and treatment of the above
medical issues and all questions were answered.
I will plan to see
again in 3 months.
Since her last visit, patient reports having cyst removal surgery with Dr
Since
surgery reports increased right arm pain described as aching, sharp, shooting that radiates from
shoulder to elbow to ulnar distribution of forearm. Continues to have bilateral hand pain. Has noted
significant changes in ADL- can shower herself, prepare dinner, better grip and use of right arm and
hand. Husband has noted improvement. Overall a 5-10% improvements. Can hold her reading
books better than before.

IMPRESSION:
1. Bibrachial wasting and weakness
2. Spinal cyst, s/p removal
3. MAG antibody neuropathy
Comment:
There has been minimal change since surgery. The elevated CSF protein and anti MAG positivity
( very low at 74) are suggestive. The EMG shows low CMAPs, prolonged latencies with normal CV,
as can be seen with anti MAG neuropathy. I am inclined to try immunotherapy to see if her
neuropathy might respond. The choices include IVIG and rituxan for this particular type of
neuropathy.
I recommend the following:
1) IVIG 2 gram/kg over 5 days, then IVIG 1 gram/kg every 3 weeks x 6 treatments
2) If no response, will discuss rituxan treatment with Dr
More than half of 40 minutes was spent discussing the pathophysiology and treatment of the above
medical issues and all questions were answered.
I will plan to see
again in 3 months.

Interpretation
This individual's MP Evaluation is negative for all assays performed, andtherefore, it is unlikely that 
this individual's neurological symptoms areassociated with an autoimmune 
response to the antigens indicated in theTechnical Results section of 
this report.
Methods
Determination of autoantibodies for the GM1 QuattroTM of GMI,asialo-GM1 GDla and 
GD1b was performed by ELISA methodology.Individual títers are determined 
for all positive ELISA test results.
Technical Results
Direct testing for the HNPP mutation (a deletion of the PMP-22 gene)and the CMT1A mutation (a 
duplication of the PMP-22 gene) wasperformed by multiplex 
ligation probe amplification (MLPA). Thetechnical analyses, as performed 
here, are greater than 99% accurate. 1-6

Comments
The MP Evaluation analyzes an individual's specimen for the presence ofautoantibodies against the antigens 
indicated in the table in the TechnicalResults section of this report
. This analysis did not detect any abnormallyelevated autoantibody levels 
to these antigens. Therefore, it is unlikelythat this individual's 
neological symptoms are associated with anautoimmune response to 
these antigens.

Demographics
* Insurance information or copy of card
• Most recent BUN and creatinine labs (IVIG can affect
kidney function so we like a baseline.
If none is available NuFACTOR can obtain on first visit.)
• History and physical and/or office notes that include
description of disease state and need for immune globulin
• IVIG dose, frequency and duration (Our pharmacists will send
complete orders including premedications, anaphylaxis kit,
lab and nursing orders back for final signature.)
Selection of diagnosis codes and descriptors are solely the
decision of the physician and 
must be sufficiently supported
by clinical documentation. 
The Department of Justice has
recently announced the launch 
of a data analytics team to
search for the use of unusual 
codes, or diagnosis changes
between providers. Diagnosis 
changes may result in claims
audit. Changes to diagnosis 
codes and descriptors during
the course of therapy, or when 
a beneficiary changes
providers, should be supported 
by clinical documentation
including labs, test results 
or other descriptors outlining 
the
change in diagnosis.

have changed in retrospect dating back to May of 2016. In the summer of 2016 he began
having difficulty with walking. He noticed he was having ski troubles that winter. His
coordination in his hands became more difficult throughout 2017. For the last 6-9 months he
has had a progressive decline in the speech. He also reports some dream enactment
behavior for the last 2-3 years. He will strike out of his wife or scream out in his sleep. The
dreams are not necessarily those of defense against attack. He has had some mild snoring
but no apneic episodes. He denies any stridor. He has had some erectile dysfunction over the
last year although can still occasionally can still undergo ejaculation but his erections are less
strong. He has had a couple of episodes of bladder incontinence. He denies any orthostasis
symptoms. He has not had any constipation or loss of sense of smell.
An extensive workup was done outside and he was found to have TTG antibody positivity
although a previous biopsy of the small bowel was negative for celiac disease. He has been
on a gluten free diet for the last 2 months without noticing much difference to his symptoms.
He was also found to have other positive autoimmune antibodies (see below). He was
evaluated at the Massachusetts general Hospital by Dr. Schmamann, and ataxia specialist.
He wondered about autoimmune ataxia and a tried to get IVIG covered by insurance but were
declined on 2 occasions. He has not underwent any immunotherapy. That doctor also was
concerned about the possibility of multiple system atrophy.
The following portions of the patient's history were reviewed and updated as appropriate:
allergies, current medications, family history, medical history, social history, surgical history
and problem list.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
A ten system review of constitutional, cardiovascular, respiratory, musculoskeletal, endocrine,
skin, SHEENT, genitourinary, psychiatric and neurologic systems was obtained and is

FAMILY HISTORY
His mother had tremors but this was thought to be due to bipolar medication. He has a sister
with bipolar.
SOCIAL HISTORY
He is a nonsmoker and does not drink much alcohol.
PHYSICAL EXAM
There were no vitals taken for this visit.
For details of the neurologic examination, please see the neurologic examination form.
I performed focused neurological examination today. The patient had evidence of truncal
ataxia and positive Romberg sign. He had a wide-based gait was unable to do tandem. He
had evidence of an ataxic dysarthria and some slowed eye movements. He had moderate
appendicular ataxia. Please see Dr. Kumar note for the remainder of the examination details.
LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS
His outside testing include a borderline vitamin B12 for which she was placed on replacement
therapy. His vitamin E level of vitamin B6 were normal. He had positive TTG IgG and gliadin
IgG. A CSF study showed a white blood cell count of 1 red blood cell count of 0 glucose of 61
protein of 73 and negative oligoclonal bands and normal IgG index. CSF cytology was normal.
He had positive SSA, SSB, anti SAM and rheumatoid factor. EMGs were normal.
Thermoregulatory sweat test showed some decreased sweating across the thighs and in the
distal hands and feet that could be suggestive of an autoimmune disorder. He had a
paraneoplastic autoantibody evaluation and autoimmune encephalopathy panel sent here to
Mayo Clinic. This was positive for gad 65 at low level (0.09 and 0.12). All other antibodies
were negative. A repeat PET-CT of his body showed no evidence of any recurrence of
malignancy. This is currently being reviewed by our radiologist.
NEUROIMAGING
MRI of the cervical spine showed some moderate stenosis at the C3-C4 level. MRI of the
brain to my eye shows some atrophy in the cerebellum as well as some possible development
of some hot cross pons signal within the mid pons. There may also be some pontine atrophy.
These images were from January 24, 2018 and are not changed much from the MRI's a year
prior to that.
IMPRESSON / REPORT / PLAN
#1 Progressive ataxia, dream enactment behavior and autonomic dysfunction, concerning for
possible multiple system atrophy type C
#2 Serological markers of celiac disease
#3 Serological markers of autoimmunity
The constellation of findings are somewhat concerning for multiple system atrophy type C.
The brain MRI does show some possible atrophy within the pontine region and I think we
should repeat that now to see if that progressed or if there is clear hot cross bun pattern that
would be suggestive. The autonomic reflex screen will be done later today. The patient does
have markers of autoimmunity and celiac disease which could suggest that they have a
coexisting autoimmune ataxia. They had been recommended to pursue IVIG but has not been
covered by insurance and he is IgA deficient which complicates things. They could consider
steroid trial in its place with intermittent IV steroids starting what once a day for 5 days
followed by once weekly for 5 weeks and then every other week for 6 weeks. Please see the
steroid template below for details. Given the low positive GAD65 there would be a risk of
precipitating diabetes with the steroids and that would need to be followed closely locally. The
lack of inflammatory spinal fluid, lack of neural antibodies at high level and multiple features
favoring MSA argue more towards that diagnosis.
However, if the remaining of his tests are strongly suggestive of multiple system atrophy |
would either consider a shorter trial of 6 weeks or no trial at all, as I think that's the more likely
diagnosis. Pursuing clinical trials in that regard may be the better option. I'd be happy to
discuss with Dr. Kumar once those results come back.
IV METHYLPREDNISOLONE RECOMMENDED 12-WEEK TREATMENT PROTOCOL
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION OF IV METHYLPREDNISOLONE
One gram IV once per day for five consecutive days, then once weekly for five weeks followed
by once every two weeks for six weeks, for a total of 12 weeks of therapy. After 12 weeks of
the therapy, it is imperative that the patient be seen in follow up for objective testing and
examination at least within 1 week following the last administration.
It is generally recommended that patients on a prolonged course of steroid take the following:
(1) Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) DS one tablet three times per week for
Pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis. For patients who are allergic to sulfa, alternatives include
dapsone 50 mg PO daily plus pyrimethamine 50 mg PO weekly plus leucovorin 25 mg PO
weekly, or aerosolized pentamidine 300 mg every four weeks. (2) Proton pump inhibitor
(omeprazole) or H2 inhibitor (ranitidine) for gastrointestinal prophylaxis. (3) Calcium 1500 mg
(elemental calcium) and vitamin D 800 units daily.
SIDE EFFECTS OF METHYLPREDNISOLONE
Administration of IV steroids can lead to avascular necrosis of the hip. Although very rare, this
condition should be considered if a patient receiving IV steroid experiences new hip or groin
pain. Other significant side effects to be aware of include gastrointestinal ulceration, especially
in the setting of an underlying ulcer. Blood glucose levels may rise while on steroids, and
individuals with diabetes should be particularly cognizant of glucose levels while on steroids. It
is not uncommon for those without known diabetes to develop glucose intolerance after
steroids are initiated. Patients are more vulnerable to infections during steroid administration.
Other side effects include osteopenia/osteoporosis, which usually occur with more prolonged
administration. Individuals with an underlying psychiatric disorder should be aware of ""steroid
psychosis"" although this can occur even without an underlying psychiatric diagnosis. Other
side effects include, but are not limited to: hypertension, electrolyte imbalances, cataracts,
increased intraocular pressure/glaucoma, nervousness, insomnia (especially the night of the
infusion), fluid retention/edema, skin changes, weight gain, and Cushing's syndrome.
MONITORING WHILE TAKING METHYLPREDNISOLONE
Prior to administering IV steroids, the following should be checked: blood pressure, serum
glucose and electrolytes, and urine pregnancy screen when applicable. During administration,
particular attention should be paid to symptoms such as hip or groin pain, signs or symptoms
of infection, or significant abdominal pain. For individuals with known diabetes, close glucose
monitoring is required as adjustments in insulin doses may be required both during initiation of
the steroids and with discontinuance. Patient should not receive live vaccines while on this
treatment.
SURVEILLANCE WHILE TAKING METHYLPREDNISOLONE
After the 12-week trial, the patient should be evaluated for objective and subjective
improvement of the neurological disorder. If there is evidence of improvement, the steroid
therapy will likely be continued with gradually widening dosing intervals over a period of three
to six months. It is at this time that consideration of steroid-sparing immunosuppressants will
be considered and initiated (azathioprine, mycophenolate). If the steroid-sparing agent is
initiated, a regimen for further steroid taper will be devised.

Follow up
Re:
year old
On
I saw
in neuromuscular consultation once again. He is a
male seeing me for the chief complaint of weakness and tightness of the right arm and leg. After last visit,
he had a 3 day boost dose following by 55 grams every 3 weeks. Following that he reports things have
gotten much better. He has much better range of motion and strength in his right arm, as well as strength in
right leg. There have been no falls since last seen. He has been working with a PT and swimming as well.
He can do a lot more exercises with weights now than he could previously. He feels noticeable difference
since going back to 3 weeks after the attempt at extension to 4 weeks.
He had some mild headaches with the 3 day boost but they resolved and haven't returned since.
Neurologic Review of Systems:
No cramps or muscle twitching. No persistent numbness or tingling in the hands or feet. No injuries without
appreciating it. Has no problems feeling hot and cold water. No problems with balance. No falls. Does not
trip on curbs and sidewalk cracks. There have been no falls. No problems with urine or bowel incontinence.
There are problems with zipping, snapping, and buttoning. Writing is changed. No persistent numbness or
tingling in the fingers. Denies neck pain, neck stiffness or low back pain. Has no problems speaking,
chewing, breathing or swallowing. No problems holding the neck up. No problems with hearing or dizziness.
No loss of vision, blurred vision, or double vision. There is no weakness of the lids. There are no problems
with headache, seizures, or fainting. No problems with memory or personality change.
Laboratory Studies
+ CANCA and Proteinase 3
Repeat MRI showed stable T2 signals in the mid portion of the body of the corpus callosum and
White matter consistent with chronic inflammatory disease. There is an area of mildly increased
susceptibility in the left motor cortex consistent with iron deposition. No change from previous in the
summer of 2015.

has demonstrated a clear response to the 3 week dosing of IVIG. There is better strength in his
legs on exam
, and he 
feels subjectively there has been a clear improvement in his function. He willcontinue 
with the current dosing at 55 grams every 3 weeks. We discussed possibility of switching to subqdosing to accommodate his work 
schedule which he will consider. He will continue with physical therapywhich has been helpful to 
him, and a new prescription was given to him. Additionally we reviewed his newMRI done over the summer which 
showed no significant changes since prior study. We discussed getting aTMS done at next visit to 
evaluate his corticospinal involvement which he is in agreement with.
The diagnosis remains compatible with a peripheral and central neurogenic disease manifest as abnormalEMG studies (
reason for referral) and findings suggestive of demyelinating disease. The elevatedautoimmune markers 
may be indicative of etiology and the basis of IVIG responsive.
clinical syndrome was reviewed with our team and therapeutic goals discussed. Occupational,
and respiratory therapy therapy services were delivered an progress note
Of the 60 minute visit, 40 minutes were devoted to face to face counseling with reviewing the
potential causes of problems, need for additional testing, describing the tests and emphasizing theimportance of therapy, 
exercise and diet. A discussion of the plan after the tests was discussed. We agreeand will make 
the appropriate appointments.
Impression:
1. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome
2. MMN (multifocal motor neuropathy)
3. Weakness
4. Gait disorder
Plan
1. TMS prior to next appointment.
2. Continue IVIG every 3 weeks, will consider subQ in future.

History of Present Illness
54 year old male who is here for a follow up up visit which was schedueld to discuss the EMG/NCS results and further managementplan. He denies new 
complaints since the last vislt. He continues to have similar weakness and spasms in the Left-Right extremities.
Summary from the previous notes;
He muscle cramps. The symptoms began a year ago mainly in the calves and lower legs, gradually evolving to involve all four limbs. He
reports dystonia of the left right hand while handing cutlery and driving. He reports left hand weakness for the last two months. Deniesparesthesias
. No neck pain. No recent falls or injuries. Fenobfibrate was doed but there was no improvement in the symptoms. He wasfound to have to 
have slighty elevated CPK and hypercalcemia( now normalized). Other labs including ACE are normal.
Interim studies:
EMG/NCS
: A complex study demonstrating a disorder of motor neurons and for their axons. Specifically, the study
does demonstrate a motor neuronopathy in that all motor nergves studles in the lower extremities and the right median nerve
demonstrate low amplitude, slowed conduction velocities and notably there is conduction block demonstrated at the tibial nervesbilaterally. SNAPs 
are normal. There is profuse denervation present in three limbs.
The EMG/NCS were discussed with
over phone. The findings are suggestive of Multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction
block vs Motor neuron disease.
MRI cervical spine: Severe degenerative disc disease c6-7.Multi level degenerative disc disease.

I had the pleasure of seeing,
here today in my clinic. He is a 33-year-old right-
handed young man who is here for a second opinion neurologic consultation. He relayed the
history and in addition I reviewed his records from
which I will
summarize from my records below.
says he has

woke up with swelling of the left side of his face. He went to the
Emergency Room where he was admitted and on the next day he developed weakness and
numbness in the right lower extremity which ascended and somewhat involved the left lower
extremity as well. At the time, he was also profoundly hyperreflexic. He was evaluated with an
MRI of his entire neuro access which did not reveal any abnormalities. He was thought to have
acute parotitis. Serologies were positive for a CMV DNA PCR which was positive as well as
EBV DNA PCR. He was seen by Dr.
in the hospital who thought that there was
a functional component to his exam and most recently he had nerve conduction and EMG which
he was told was reportedly normal, but I do not have the report to review.
regained about 20% of the feeling in his right leg and his left lower leg is about 50%. He also
still has numbness in his face more so on the left just over the last three days. He says that his
joints all started to hurt and he had a migraine for the past 10 days. He does not have a headache
today. The headache was frontal and retro orbital. He was taking Tylenol or ibuprofen almost
daily for the past 10 days. Prior to all his symptoms, he also had about two weeks of some
memory and concentration difficulties which are persisting. He also had fatigue for the past for
the week prior to his onset as well as some tremors for the past month. Just prior to this, he had
an episode of diarrhea as well as travel to for seven days where he had mosquito bites.
He also over the weekend developed an erythematous blanching rash which started in his groin
and then spread to the rest of his body. Whenever he tries to weight bear on his right leg, he gets
an electric shock at the back of his leg. His right knee also has a dull ache which makes it
difficult to sleep and has not responded to any over-the-counter pain medications. He was
already under the care of a psychiatrist who he was seeing monthly and more recently saw his
psychiatrist associate who is a specialist in conversion disorders who reportedly does not think
that this is a conversion disorder. He has been stable on his medications. He is HIV positive, but
his viral load is negative. He takes Ativan 2 mg at night for sleep as well as Zoloft 150 mg,
Trazodone as needed and He is undergoing physical therapy about once a week and then
also working on exercise and trying to be mobile at home. He is ambulating with the assistance
of a walker. He has a history of social anxiety and not generalized anxiety disorder. He was not
under any particular stress at the onset of this illness although now his illness has become
stressful because he is only out of work until next week and is unsure when he can go back. He
does want to return to his job. He is an executive assistant and is worried about losing his job
because of this illness.

On examination, is thin. He still has some residual left parotid swelling as well as
swollen cervical lymph nodes. He has decreased sensation to light touch over only the V2
distribution which does not exactly split midline as well as a mild hypoesthesia to temperature in
that distribution. The remainder of his cranial nerve examination was unremarkable. He has
slightly increased tone in the lower extremities with normal bulk. In addition, his feet are
somewhat cyanotic and cool to the touch. His reflexes were 2 to 3+ throughout. They were one
to two beats of clonus bilaterally. Sensation was decreased to touch over the right greater than
left lower extremities and a stocking distribution somewhat improving below the knee and the
right leg and at the ankle on the left. This did not fit any dermatomal distribution although was
somewhat more decreased on the dorsum of the foot. On strength examination, there was a large
component of give-away weakness. Initial strength was 5+ with the exception of right foot
dorsiflexion which was about 4/5. Toe extension was also about 4/5. Vibration sensation was
intact. There was a high-frequency low-amplitude postural tremor which seemed to increase
with action. There was no pronator drift. He was able to walk with a walker, but the gait is more
antalgic and although he was unable to dorsiflex, he was able to walk up on his right toe.
In summary,
is a 33-year-old young man with a history of HIV with undetectable viral
load and high CD4 count who is here for a second opinion neurologic consultation regarding
lower extremity, ascending weakness as well as sensory change. He also had diffuse
hyperreflexia upon presentation in the hospital two weeks ago which has since improved. His
weakness is also improving. Although there are some inconsistencies on his exam, I do believe
that there is some basis for his symptoms whether this represents a viral or post viral neuropathy
or meningoencephalitis especially given the hyperreflexia and mixed peripheral and central
signs. His CMV and EBV were positive and certainly those could cause this type of patterns. I
would be interested in seeing his EMG and nerve conduction study results. Regardless of
ideology, I think that he should continue with physical therapy to help with his gait as well as
regular followup with his psychiatrist. Given the arthralgias, if not already checked I would also
recommend checking HHV-6 and coccidioidomycosis as well as possibly repeating EBV and
CMV DNA PCR. has an appointment with his infectious diseases physician tomorrow
Dr and I would defer this workup to her. Finally, returning to work appears to be a great
source of stress for as he enjoys his job, but is unable to perform the duties in his current
capacity. I recommended therefore that he take a leave for at least one to two months and that he
can always go back earlier if he recovers quicker.
It was a pleasure caring for today. This visit was a total of 80 minutes in duration, greater
than 50% of which was spent in face-to-face counseling with the patient.
Sincerely,
MD

History of Present Illness
History:
Dear
returns today for follow-up of her myasthenia gravis,
CIDP, Sjogren's related neuropathy, Molleret's meningitis cerebral
aneurysms, and migraine.
Since her last visit she is no longer wearing a boot on her right
foot, but continues to wear an immobilizer boot on the left foot
because her fracture has still not healed. She believes the delayed
healing is attributed to prednisone which has been reduced to 8 mg
daily.
She just resumed Rituxan but has not had any gammaglobulin for
months. She also has not resumed CellCept. She feels that she has
gotten gradually weaker in all extremities, worse on the left. She has
noted increasing ptosis of both eyelids with intermittent horizontal
diplopia, especially when tired at the end of the day.
She has had decreased vision and apparently has developed
Plaquenil related retinopathy for which she is being evaluated at Wills.
She continues to work as best she can using an enhanced computer
screen but is finding it increasingly difficult.
She has had one of her diffuse headaches, somewhat worse on the
right, for about 2 weeks, mild to moderate in intensity, without other
manifestations on extensive review. The pain is steady, non-throbbing,
not related to position or activity
She continues to have numbness and dysesthesias in all 4
extremities and also her face, worse on the left, with burning
sensations on her tongue, as before.

Patient History:
Patient is a 79 year-old female who presents with weakness in the bilateral LEs. The patient was dx with GBS
on 12/31/18 admitted to PVMC,
NCV/EMG Findings:
Evaluation of the Left peroneal motor and the Right peroneal motor nerves showed normal distal onset latency
(14.7, R5.8 ms), reduced amplitude (L1.7, R.1.1 mV), normal conduction velocity (B Fib-Ankle 9cm, L44, R47
m/s), and decreased conduction velocity (Poplt-B Fib, L30, R41 m/s). The Left superficial peroneal sensory
and the Right superficial peroneal sensory nerves showed NONE response (14 cm). The Left sural sensory and
the Right sural sensory nerves showed NONE response (Calf). The Left Tibial AHB motor nerve showed
normal distal onset latency (6.6 ms), reduced amplitude (1.2 mV), and decreased conduction velocity (Knee-
Ankle 10cm, 35 m/s). The Right Tibial AHB motor nerve showed prolonged distal onset latency (6.9 ms),
reduced amplitude (0.5 mV), and decreased conduction velocity (Knee-Ankle 10cm, 36 m/s).
F Wave studies indicate that the Left peroneal F wave, the Left tibial F wave, and the Right tibial F wave had
prolonged latency. The Right peroneal F wave had no evoked response.
H-reflex studies indicate that the Left tibial H-reflex has prolonged latency (37.24 ms). The Right tibial H-
reflex has prolonged latency (37.24 ms).
Needle evaluation of the Right peroneus longus muscle showed normal insertional activity, normal spontaneous
activity, normal motor unit amplitude, increased motor unit duration, Normal polyphasic potentials, normal
recruitment, and normal interference pattern. The Right medial gastrocnemius muscle showed normal
insertional activity, normal spontaneous activity, mildly increased motor unit amplitude, motor unit duration,
Normal polyphasic potentials, diminished recruitment, and normal interference pattern. The Right posterior
tibialis muscle showed normal insertional activity, normal spontaneous activity, moderately increased motor
unit amplitude, motor unit duration, moderately increased polyphasic potentials, diminished recruitment, and
normal interference pattern. All remaining muscles (as indicated in the following table) showed no evidence of
electrical instability.

Impression
This is an abnormal electrodiagnostic study indicative of chronic sensorimotor polyneuropathy of bilateral
lower extremities. CIDP is not excluded. Clinical correlation is advised.

m/s), and decreased conduction velocity (Poplt-B Fib, L30, R41 m/s). The Left superficial peroneal sensory
and the Right superficial peroneal sensory nerves showed NONE response (14 cm). The Left sural sensory and
the Right sural sensory nerves showed NONE response (Calf). The Left Tibial AHB motor nerve showed
normal distal onset latency (6.6 ms), reduced amplitude (1.2 mV), and decreased conduction velocity (Knee-
Ankle 10cm, 35 m/s). The Right Tibial AHB motor nerve showed prolonged distal onset latency (6.9 ms),
reduced amplitude (0.5 mV), and decreased conduction velocity (Knee-Ankle 10cm, 36 m/s).
F Wave studies indicate that the Left peroneal F wave, the Left tibial F wave, and the Right tibial F wave had
prolonged latency. The Right peroneal F wave had no evoked response.
H-reflex studies indicate that the Left tibial H-reflex has prolonged latency (37.24 ms). The Right tibial H-
reflex has prolonged latency (37.24 ms).
Needle evaluation of the Right peroneus longus muscle showed normal insertional activity, normal spontaneous
activity, normal motor unit amplitude, increased motor unit duration, Normal polyphasic potentials, normal
recruitment, and normal interference pattern. The Right medial gastrocnemius muscle showed normal
insertional activity, normal spontaneous activity, mildly increased motor unit amplitude, motor unit duration,
Normal polyphasic potentials, diminished recruitment, and normal interference pattern. The Right posterior
tibialis muscle showed normal insertional activity, normal spontaneous activity, moderately increased motor
unit amplitude, motor unit duration, moderately increased polyphasic potentials, diminished recruitment, and
normal interference pattern. All remaining muscles (as indicated in the following table) showed no evidence of
electrical instability.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Today we had the pleasure of seeing
This was his follow-up visit for multifocal motor neuropathy.
in the
with
is a 75-year-old, pleasant man who back in
|developed left distal hand weakness
with no sensory symptoms. He was initially evaluated by MRI of the C-spine which did not show any evidence
of spinal cord injury or cervical radiculopathy. Then an EMG in |
showed acute and chronic
denervation in distal left hand muscles which favored C8-T1 distribution. There was a possible conduction
block in forearm segment of median nerve, and disproportionate denervation in median and ulnar compared to
C8 radial innervated muscles. There was no evidence of generalized motor neuron disease given the normal
EMG in left upper extremity in the proximal segments as well as in the left leg.
He had a negative lab workup including GM1 antibodies as well as blood testing. Because of presumed
multifocal motor neuropathy, he was started on IVIg 2 g/kg divided over five days in
with
which he denied any subjective improvement. However, with dynamometry strength testing there was objective
improvement.
He was then seen in
at which time he reported stable symptoms and continued trouble with
buttoning his shirts or tieing his shoes, or anything that needed his thumb to move. At that time it was decided
to start him on monthly IVIg treatment. He got one dose in
followed by another one in
and the last one in
ten days before this clinic visit.
Patient returned today to clinic for follow-up. He still reported stable symptoms and has not subjectively felt
any improvement, but thinks that his progression might have stopped as he denied any worsening of symptoms.
His GM1 antibodies checked twice turned out negative. However, antibody panel showed NS6S antibodies in
the past when checked in
He denied any trouble chewing, swallowing, breathing, any double vision, or slurred speech.

Encounter Information
Past medical, surgical, social, and family history are unchanged since last visit.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
A complete review of symptoms was performed including constitutional symptoms, cardiovascular, respiratory,
gastrointestinal, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, neurological, psychiatric, endocrine, immunologic,
integumentary, hematological, eyes, ears, nose, mouth and throat. All symptoms negative except as per HPI.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 146/89, heart rate 68.
GENERAL: Patient is not in any acute distress.
HEENT: Head and neck examination is normocephalic, atraumatic.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm.
RESPIRATORY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
EXTREMITIES: No pitting edema noted.
SKIN: Revealed no rashes, edema, or swelling.
NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION:
MENTAL STATUS: The patient is awake, alert, oriented. He is able to follow commands without any
difficulty.
CRANIAL NERVES: Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. Extraocular movements are intact. No facial
weakness or numbness noted. Palatal elevation is equal bilaterally. Tongue protrudes in midline. No atrophy
or fasciculations noted in the tongue. Shoulder shrug and sternocleidomastoid strength is within normal limits.
MOTOR: Normal muscle tone and bulk. However, some muscle wasting is noted in the left hand intrinsic
muscles, mostly in the thenar eminence and the FDI. Strength is 5/5 except for 4-/5 in left FDI and APB, and
4/5 in left finger extensors. Dynamometry numbers are as follows:
Deltoid
Biceps
Triceps
Wrist extensor
Finger extension
FDI
APB
Grip
Iliopsoas
Quadriceps
Hamstring
Foot dorsiflexion

is a 75-year-old man who back in started developing left distal hand weakness without any
sensory symptoms. EMG in showed findings suggestive of multifocal neuropathy, and no evidence of
ALS. He had a negative MRI C-spine for myelopathy or radiculopathy. Labs returned unremarkable including
negative GM1 antibodies twice, but positive NS6S antibodies.he was treated with one dose of IVIg at 2 g/kg in
with no subjective improvement. However, objective improvement noticed. In
started on monthly IVIg 1 g/kg every four weeks (500 mg/kg day one, and 500 mg/kg day two). Today he
returned for follow-up with stable or somewhat improved objective strength in his distal left upper extremity,
and we will proceed as follows:
1. We will continue 1 g/kg dose divided over two days every four weeks. Patient reported some headaches
with IVIg infusions, so we will try to switch it to sub.q. IG.
2. Today we will not do any lab testing.
3. Patient will follow up with us in six months. However, in the case of any worsening symptoms or new
neurological symptoms, he was advised to call the clinic.

was personally evaluated and discussed with Dr. History and physical examination were
obtained by myself. He has a motor neuropathy that seems to have been improving on IVIg. His exam today
shows increased strength compared to last visit. The plan is to follow him. He will have regular
immunoglobulin treatments, at first IVIg, and if he has headaches we may decide to use a subcutaneous
immunoglobulin.

Provider:
Primary diagnosis: MMN (multifocal motor neuropathy) (Notable Code)
Reason for Visit: Neuropathy; Referred by Crago,
Progress Notes
Interim History
I saw the patient for followup of peripheral neuropathy. He was last seen in in the clinic in 2018 and
had an EMG/NCS in 2018 that showed possible multifocal motor neuropathy. He was last seen in
2018. Since then, he started with IVIG Infusions, resulting in some improvement. However
he does complain of myalglas for couple of days after the infusion. Denies other new issues.
The patient reports no pain and no sensory loss. There is no history of recent falls and mildly unsteady
gait. Energy level is not good. Pain is absent. Pain is unchanged since the last visit. Numbness is
present and involves the right heel. Ataxla is absent. Weakness is present and involves distal arm and
leg muscles.
Medications:
HCTZ, famotidine, esomeprazole, cyclobenzaprine, losartan, amlodipine

Impression:
The patient has peripheral neuropathy that is under fair control. Etiology of neuropathy is probably
autoimmune. The presence of elevated GM1 antibody titer and conduction block on EMG support the
dlagnosis of multifocal motor neuropathy. At this time we will continue with current regimen, and we have
also discussed a possibility of switching to SCIG which would give him more independence. Additionally,we may consider 
starting prednisone 20 mg one day before IVIG and continued for 2 days of Infusions toreduce 
side effects. We will also have to monitor with his kidney function, although his recent drop may
be 
related to 
readjustment of his antihypertensives, rather than IVIG. This was discussed with his primarycare 
physician as well.

Medications: Continue IVIG 90 grams every 4 weeks/consider switch to SCIG

Reason for Visit: Neuropathy; Referred by Crago,
Progress Notes
Interim History
I saw the patient for followup of peripheral neuropathy. He was last seen in in the clinic in 2018 and
had an EMG/NCS in 2018 that showed possible multifocal motor neuropathy. He was last seen in
2018. Since then, he started with IVIG Infusions, resulting in some improvement. However
he does complain of myalglas for couple of days after the infusion. Denies other new issues.
The patient reports no pain and no sensory loss. There is no history of recent falls and mildly unsteady
gait. Energy level is not good. Pain is absent. Pain is unchanged since the last visit. Numbness is
present and involves the right heel. Ataxla is absent. Weakness is present and involves distal arm and
leg muscles.

although patient is deep tendon reflexes are not absent, patient stated
that the deep tendon reflexes are significantly depressed when she was
seen by her primary physician. Although patient's symptoms are better
than before, but patient still has weakness in upper and lower
extremities, we'll do labs anti-GM 1 antibody, anti-mag antibodies,
ANA, Sjogren profile, CPK, and EMG nerve conduction study, have
given the patient from neuropathic pain, and meloxicam for
muscle aches, and advised the patient for any worsening or shortness of
breath to go immediately to the emergency room, in addition, will do
MRI of the brain to rule out structural lesion versus demyelinating
disease. Because of the normal. Deep tendon reflexes, all the questions

There is slight interval improvement in his gait and LE weakness however he is far from
baseline. He also reports increasing fatigue and exahustion with mild exertion. Daughter
also reports facialswelling which is similar to what he had during his inpatient stay at
HUMC. He had undergone MRI face/orbit which was most ly unremarkable.
Patient work as a custodian involves physical labor and at this time I do not feel that he
could return to that intensty of work. Moreover his medications are also being titrated.
He has not seen Heme-Oncologist yet and was advsed to do so.

There is mild narrowing of the neural foramen bilaterally. No significant spinal canal stenosis is present.
At the 14-L5 level there is a moderate circumferential disc herniation with a more focal central disc
protrusion. Postcontrast imaging demonstrates a trace amount of surrounding enhancement suggestive of
inflammatory as opposed to infectious discitis. There is no evidence for bone infection. Degenerative
endplate changes are identified. There is no definite epidural abscess formation or collection,
There is mild to moderate neural foraminal stenosis bilaterally and spinal canal stenosis.
At the L5-S1 level, there is a circumferential disc bulge with increased signal in the posterior annular
fibers on Image 12 of series 3 suggestive of a small annular tear.

Mild enhancement of the facet of L4-1.5 and L5-S1 is present likely related to inflammatory arthropathy.Trace amount of nonspecific 
enhancement to the subcutancous tissue is identified of the level of
approximately L5 3 through L5.
Impression:
At the 14-L5 level there is a moderate circumferential disc herniation with a more focal central disc
protrusion. Postcontrast images demonstrates a trace amount of adjacent enhancement. This likely is
related to inflammatory as opposed to infectious discitis. Clinical correlation is advised.
Trace amount of enhancement to the facet of L4-L5 and L5-S1 bilaterally likely related to inflammatory
arthropathy.
Mild multilevel disc disease and degenerative change as described above.

EMG/NERVE CONDUCTION STUDY
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
RE:
DATE:
EMG Nerve Conduction testing is requested specifically to evaluate for CIDP. The
differential diagnosis includes cervical radiculopathy vs. lumbosacral plexopathy vs.
brachial plexopathy vs. peripheral neuropathy vs. myopathy vs. motor neuron disease
vs. peripheral nerve entrapment syndrome.
Limb Temperature: Temperature maintained above 32° for upper extremities and
above 30° for lower extremities.
NCS RESULTS: Electrodiagnostic testing is performed in 3 extremities. There is
moderate prolongation distal motor latency with low normal amplitude response and
slow conduction velocity right median motor nerve. Normal distal motor latency right
ulnar motor nerve. However, there is slow conduction velocity of the right ulnar motor
nerve in the wrist to below elbow segment. There was no evidence of temporal
dispersion or conduction block of the right median or ulnar motor nerve responses.
There is prolongation right median and ulnar F waves. No response right peroneal
motor nerve. There is greater than 50% prolongation of the distal motor latencies left
peroneal and bilateral tibial motor nerves. There is severe reduction in the motor
conduction velocities greater than 30% below the lower limit of normal left peroneal, left
tibial motor nerves. There is conduction block of the right tibial motor nerve with an
absence or a proximal response. There is mild prolongation distal sensory latency with
reduced amplitude response right median sensory nerve. No response right radial, right
sural or left superficial peroneal sensory nerves. Relatively normal response right ulnar
sensory nerve.
EMG RESULTS: Needle EMG is performed right upper extremity and bilateral lower
extremities. In the right upper extremity abnormalities are confined to the more distal
muscle, 1st dorsal interosseous with fibrillation potentials as well as large polyphasic
potentials of prolonged duration and decreased recruitment motor unit potentials. In the
lower extremities, the findings revealed diffuse fibrillation potentials more prominent
distally with large polyphasic potentials of prolonged duration and decreased
recruitment motor unit potentials. Normal needle EMG findings seen in the bilateral
lumbar and right cervical paraspinals.
ELECTRODIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal electrodiagnostic studies
with findings of a moderately severe sensory motor peripheral neuropathy, with
advanced demyelination as well as axonal loss in the lower extremities.

COMMENT:
1. The clinical history and electrodiagnostic findings suggest a chronic process.
These findings can be seen with chronic inflammatory demyelinating
polyneuropathy where there is motor distal latency prolongation greater than or
equal to 50% above the upper limit of normal in 2 nerves excluding the median
neuropathy at the wrists. There was also a reduction of motor conduction
velocity greater than or equal to 30% below the lower limit of normal in 2 nerves.
2. Unable to delineate cervical radiculopathy, brachial plexopathy, lumbosacral
radiculopathy or lumbosacral plexopathy given the setting of advanced
generalized peripheral neuropathy.
3. This study is not consistent with a myopathy.
4. Given the abnormalities in the sensory nerve responses with the absence of
fasciculation potentials, these findings are more consistent with an advanced
peripheral neuropathy rather than motor neuron disease.
5. I discussed with patient and her husband would consider follow up testing in 4 to
6 months or sooner if clinically indicated, pending her response to treatment.
6. See Physical Medicine Evaluation for additional details.

40 units at bedtime. She reports a recent hemoglobin A1C of 7%.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: A hemia repair and an ovary and fallopian tube
removed.

SOCIAL HISTORY: She is married and accompanied by her husband. She has not
been employed outside the home in many years. She is a homemaker. She does not
smoke. She does not drink alcohol. No recreational drug use. She has a wheelchair, a
walker. She also has a shower chair with a transfer board. She does require set up with
bathing. I discussed with the patient and her husband that she is not safe to be in a
shower independently and should have assistance while showering and transfers as
she remains a fall risk.
Glucose
She recently underwent evaluation of cerebral spinal fluid on
elevated at 16. Protein was markedly elevated at 125.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She presents today in a standard wheelchair. She
requires assistance to ascend to an exam table. She is advised not to stand or transfer
without assistance. Her speech is fluent. No facial asymmetry. Deep tendon reflexes
are absent in all 4 extremities. There is no Babinski. There is no ankle clonus. There is
significant intrinsic muscular atrophy of the feet more so than the hands. Tinel's sign is
negative at the carpal tunnel of both wrists and the cubital tunnel of both elbows.
Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses symmetrical and intact. There is no calf
tenderness. There is no pedal edema. Examination does not suggest phlebitis. In the
upper extremities motor is intact with the exception of 4/5 weakness in the intrinsics
including long finger extensors and small finger spreaders. In the lower extremities she
has diffuse muscular weakness, more prominent distally and worse on the left with 3/5
right hip flexors, 4/5 right knee extensors, 3/5 right ankle dorsiflexors, 3-15 right great toe
extensors. On the left side there is 3-5 left hip flexors, 4-15 left knee extensors, 3-/5 left
ankle dorsiflexors and 2/5 left great toe extensors.
IMPRESSION: This is a 57 year old right hand dominant female who describes a 10
month history of progressive weakness in the lower extremities such that she is
currently non-ambulatory and mobile by a wheelchair. She describes a chronic
progressive stepwise relatively symmetric proximal and distal weakness with sensory
dysfunction of all 4 extremities. The symptoms have been present for over 2 months.
Deep tendon reflexes are absent. Her clinical history, the cerebral spinal fluid findings
and the electrodiagnostic findings do suggest the inclusion criteria for CIDP. She has no
history to support a hereditary demyelinating neuropathy. She denied any sphinicter
disturbance. Clearly, she is at risk for a diabetic neuropathy, however the onset of
abrupt progressive rapid weakness seems more inclusive of a CIDP but cannot rule out
a superimposed diabetic neuropathy as well.
